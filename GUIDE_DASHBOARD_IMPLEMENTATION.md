# Complete Guide Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive guide dashboard system for hunting outfitters that provides guides with personalized access to their assigned experiences, upcoming bookings, and performance statistics.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Frontend Guide Dashboard (`client/src/pages/GuideDashboard.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **Role-based Authentication**: Automatically displays for users with 'guide' role
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live data from backend APIs using React Query
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Statistics Cards**: Shows upcoming bookings, weekly schedule, assigned experiences, and primary guide assignments
- **Interactive Tabs**: Switch between upcoming bookings and assigned experiences
- **Primary Guide Indicators**: Visual badges for experiences where guide is primary

**Key Statistics Displayed:**
- Total upcoming bookings
- Bookings in next 7 days
- Total assigned experiences
- Primary guide assignments

### 2. Backend API Routes (`server/routes/guides.ts`)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/guides/:guideId/experiences` - Fetch all experiences assigned to a guide
- `GET /api/guides/:guideId/bookings` - Fetch all bookings assigned to a guide
- `GET /api/guides/:guideId/stats` - Fetch dashboard statistics for a guide
- `POST /api/guides/assign/:experienceId` - Assign guide to experience (admin only)
- `PUT /api/guides/assignments/:id` - Update guide assignment (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/guides/assignments/:id` - Remove guide assignment (admin only)

**Security Features:**
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: All queries filtered by outfitterId
- **Role-based Access Control**: Guides can only view their own data, admins can view any
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated and sanitized

### 3. Database Storage Layer

**New Methods Added:**
- `getBookingsForGuide()` - Retrieves all bookings with guide assignments
- `getGuideStats()` - Calculates dashboard statistics with SQL aggregations
- `getGuideAssignmentsByGuideId()` - Fetches guide-experience relationships

**Query Optimizations:**
- **JOIN Operations**: Efficient joins between bookings, experiences, customers, and locations
- **Filtered Queries**: All queries include tenant isolation by outfitterId
- **Date-based Filtering**: Optimized queries for upcoming and weekly bookings
- **Aggregation Functions**: SQL COUNT operations for statistics

### 4. Role-based Routing System

**Guide User Experience:**
- Guides see simplified dashboard upon login
- Direct access to `/guide` route
- No access to admin functions like staff management or settings

**Admin User Experience:**
- Full application access including guide dashboard
- Can access guide dashboard via `/guide` route
- Maintains all existing administrative functions

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Authentication Integration
The system automatically detects user roles from the authentication system. Guides with `role: 'guide'` are redirected to the guide dashboard.

### Step 2: API Integration
All guide data is fetched through secure API endpoints that respect multi-tenant boundaries and role-based permissions.

### Step 3: Real-time Updates
The dashboard uses React Query for automatic data fetching and caching, ensuring guides always see current information.

### Step 4: Security Implementation
- **Tenant Isolation**: All queries include outfitterId filtering
- **Role Verification**: Server-side role checking on all endpoints
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

## User Interface Features

### Dashboard Header
- Personalized welcome message with guide's name
- Quick access to notifications
- Clean, professional design

### Statistics Overview
Four key metric cards showing:
1. **Upcoming Bookings**: Total future bookings assigned to guide
2. **This Week**: Bookings in next 7 days
3. **Assigned Experiences**: Total experience types guide can lead
4. **Primary Guide**: Experiences where guide is the primary leader

### Booking Management Tab
- **Comprehensive Booking Details**: Customer info, dates, guest count, location
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges for booking status
- **Sorting**: Chronological order with nearest bookings first
- **Quick Actions**: View details button for each booking

### Experience Management Tab
- **Experience Cards**: Visual grid layout showing all assigned experiences
- **Primary Badge**: Special indicator for primary guide assignments
- **Experience Details**: Duration, capacity, pricing, and location information
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to screen size automatically

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: User logs in with role-based credentials
2. **Route Selection**: System routes guides to dashboard based on role
3. **Data Fetching**: React Query fetches guide-specific data
4. **Security Filtering**: Server applies tenant and role-based filtering
5. **UI Rendering**: Dashboard displays personalized information

### Performance Optimizations
- **Query Caching**: React Query caches API responses
- **Efficient Joins**: Database queries optimized for performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device types

### Error Handling
- **Authentication Errors**: Automatic redirect to login
- **API Errors**: Graceful error messages and fallbacks
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data available

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Seamlessly integrates with existing tenant isolation
- **Authentication System**: Uses existing email/password authentication
- **Database Schema**: Works with current database structure
- **Multi-guide Assignment**: Compatible with existing guide assignment system

### Future Enhancements
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time booking notifications
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for guides
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with external calendar systems
- **Reporting**: Advanced analytics and performance reports

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Role-based Permissions**: Strict separation between guide and admin access
- **Data Isolation**: Guides can only access their own assignments
- **API Security**: All endpoints protected with authentication middleware

### Data Protection
- **Tenant Boundaries**: No cross-tenant data access
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data exposed in error messages

## Deployment Notes

### Database Requirements
- Existing schema with guide assignment tables
- Proper indexes on foreign keys for performance
- Multi-tenant data structure maintained

### Server Configuration
- Express.js server with existing middleware
- Authentication system configured
- Role-based routing enabled

### Frontend Dependencies
- React Query for data management
- Wouter for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Testing Strategy
