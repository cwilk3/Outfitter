Great detective work! The guest count fix is solid, but we just need to tweak the totalAmount extraction to match the actual request shape.

Hereâ€™s a suggested patch for your backend booking code in server/routes/public.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Extract totalAmount from bookingDetails or payment object
const rawTotalAmount = bookingDetails.totalAmount ?? req.body.payment?.totalAmount ?? null;
const parsedTotalAmount = rawTotalAmount ? Number(rawTotalAmount) : null;

// Logging for debug
console.log(`Experience price: ${experience.price}, Group size: ${groupSize}, Parsed total amount: ${parsedTotalAmount}`);

// Calculate totalAmount with fallback and validation
const totalAmount = (parsedTotalAmount && parsedTotalAmount > 0) 
  ? parsedTotalAmount 
  : experience.price * groupSize;
What this does:
Checks bookingDetails.totalAmount first, then payment.totalAmount (which matches your frontend payload).

Parses the totalAmount from string to number safely.

Falls back to calculating experience.price * groupSize if total is missing or invalid.

Adds a console log for debugging the calculation.

If you want, I can help you generate a full diff including this and improved logging. Want me to do that?

Sure! Here's an exact prompt you can give to Replit to implement the fix, including clear success criteria and review points:

Prompt for Replit:

Task:
Fix the totalAmount extraction and calculation logic in the public booking API route (server/routes/public.ts) to correctly handle the frontend payload structure where totalAmount is sent inside a payment object.

Details:
Currently, the backend booking route only checks bookingDetails.totalAmount, but the frontend sends totalAmount inside payment.totalAmount. This causes totalAmount to default incorrectly and display $0 instead of the expected total.

Required Changes:

Extract the totalAmount value from either:

bookingDetails.totalAmount (if present), OR

payment.totalAmount (if present)

Parse the extracted totalAmount from string to a number safely.

If the extracted totalAmount is missing or invalid (zero or negative), calculate totalAmount as:

js
Copy
Edit
experience.price * groupSize
Add logging statements to print the following for debugging:

experience.price

groupSize

parsed totalAmount received or calculated

Code snippet to implement:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Extract totalAmount from bookingDetails or payment object
const rawTotalAmount = bookingDetails.totalAmount ?? req.body.payment?.totalAmount ?? null;
const parsedTotalAmount = rawTotalAmount ? Number(rawTotalAmount) : null;

// Logging for debug
console.log(`Experience price: ${experience.price}, Group size: ${groupSize}, Parsed total amount: ${parsedTotalAmount}`);

// Calculate totalAmount with fallback and validation
const totalAmount = (parsedTotalAmount && parsedTotalAmount > 0) 
  ? parsedTotalAmount 
  : experience.price * groupSize;
Success Criteria:

When a booking is created with guests in the frontend payload and payment.totalAmount as a string number (e.g., "1250"), the backend correctly:

Stores the groupSize as the number of guests,

Stores the totalAmount as a number matching price * groupSize or the provided payment amount,

Does not default to zero or the base price alone incorrectly.

Booking confirmation returned to the frontend shows correct total amount.

Debug logs clearly output the price, group size, and totalAmount during booking creation.

Please provide:

A diff of the changes in server/routes/public.ts showing before and after.

Any additional comments on potential edge cases or future improvements for this calculation logic.

Confirmation that this fix preserves all existing validations and error handling.
