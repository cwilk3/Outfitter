kay, let's start with the first code maintenance task: implementing dynamic `outfitterId` in your `addOutfitterContext` middleware.

Please modify the file `server/outfitterContext.ts`.

Locate the `addOutfitterContext` function. You need to **change the line that hardcodes `req.outfitterId = 1;` to dynamically assign `req.user.outfitterId`**.

**Here are the specific changes:**

**Find this block (or similar, around lines 10-18):**
```typescript
export function addOutfitterContext(req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // For now, default to outfitter ID 1 (the default outfitter we created)
  // This will be enhanced when we implement full Replit authentication
  if (req.user) {
    req.outfitterId = 1; // Default outfitter for all authenticated users
  }
  
  next();
}
Replace it with:

TypeScript

export function addOutfitterContext(req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // Dynamically assign outfitterId from the authenticated user, for multi-tenant support
  if (req.user && req.user.outfitterId) { // Ensure req.user and its outfitterId are present
    req.outfitterId = req.user.outfitterId; // Assign the actual outfitterId from the authenticated user
  } else {
    // If no user or outfitterId is found (e.g., public route, unauthenticated request)
    // or if the authenticated user doesn't have an outfitterId (shouldn't happen for valid users)
    // ensure outfitterId is explicitly undefined or null to prevent unintended access.
    // This will cause tenant-isolated routes to correctly return 401/404.
    req.outfitterId = undefined; 
  }
  
  next();
}
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of this change. I will review it carefully before you approve.

Success Criteria for my approval:

The addOutfitterContext function's body is correctly replaced with the new logic.
The hardcoded req.outfitterId = 1; is replaced with dynamic assignment (req.outfitterId = req.user.outfitterId;).
A check for req.user && req.user.outfitterId is present.
The else block sets req.outfitterId = undefined;.
The comments reflect the new logic.
No other code lines are affected.
I will not approve the change until these criteria are met.
