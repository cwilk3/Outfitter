Pre-Launch Task Breakdown for Outfitter
This checklist outlines the remaining work required to prepare the Outfitter SaaS platform for production launch. It prioritizes core stability, mobile responsiveness, remaining feature work, and UI/UX refinement based on recent architecture assessments and functionality audits.

🥇 1. Fix Stability & Architecture Risks
Ensure the backend is modular, consistent, and maintainable.

 ✅ Remove activity tracking and associated DB constraints (done)

 🔨 Modularize backend routes — split the 1900+ line file into logical domains (e.g. /auth, /locations, /dashboard)

 🚨 Standardize backend error response format — return consistent shape like { success: false, message: "" }

 🧪 Add missing edge case validation (especially around API inputs)

 🧹 Remove duplicate method definitions in the storage interface (clean up internal logic)

🥈 2. Mobile UI Refinement
Ensure the app is fully usable and polished on mobile.

 📱 Make all key flows mobile-responsive (auth, dashboard, location management)

 ✅ Use Tailwind responsive classes to fix spacing, layout, and font scaling

 🧪 Test UX on iOS Safari and Android Chrome for layout and input handling

🥉 3. Build Final MVP Features
Add only scoped, launch-critical functionality that supports core use cases.

 🧩 Implement any remaining MVP features required for onboarding or retention

 ⚠️ Follow existing tenant/auth architecture patterns

 📦 Ensure features meet multi-tenant data isolation standards

🧼 4. UI Feedback & Loading States
Improve perceived performance and user trust during transitions and form interactions.

 ⏳ Add loading indicators for queries, auth transitions, and form submissions

 💬 Improve error messages to be human-readable and friendly

 ✅ Use toasts, inline form errors, and banners for feedback cues

🛠️ 5. Refactor for Maintainability
Increase code readability and reusability to support future dev work.

 🧹 Split large components into smaller, single-responsibility pieces

 ♻️ Refactor repetitive forms into reusable components

 🧰 Replace prop drilling with context or compositional patterns

 🔧 Fix lingering any types and tighten TypeScript usage throughout backend and frontend

🌟 6. Improve UI Hierarchy & Navigation
Enhance usability and visual clarity to support onboarding and complex workflows.

 🎨 Improve visual hierarchy using font weight, contrast, and spacing

 ✨ Add subtle micro-interactions (hover, tap, or transition feedback)

 🧭 Make navigation more intuitive — especially around switching tenants, accessing settings, etc.

🧪 7. QA & Documentation Prep
Ensure the app is test-ready and the architecture is documented for future contributors.

 ✅ Perform full QA test pass (desktop + mobile) covering core flows

 📋 Verify error logs and traces are functional in dev/staging

 📝 Update internal documentation (README or Notion) to reflect:

Route architecture (post-modularization)

Multi-tenant logic

Any reusable frontend components or hooks
