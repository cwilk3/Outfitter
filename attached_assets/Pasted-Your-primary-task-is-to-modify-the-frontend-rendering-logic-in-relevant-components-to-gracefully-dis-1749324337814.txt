Your primary task is to modify the frontend rendering logic in relevant components to gracefully display a placeholder (e.g., 'Deleted User', 'Unassigned Guide') when a user_id is linked to a record (like a booking or an experience assignment) but the corresponding users record has been hard-deleted from the database.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

Identify Affected Components: This primarily affects places where User details (like firstName, lastName, email) are displayed based on a user_id. Likely candidates include:

Staff List: If a deleted user is somehow still in the list (though our deletion should remove them).
Experience Guide Assignment Display: (client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx) where assignedGuides are displayed.
Booking Details: (e.g., client/src/pages/BookingDetails.tsx or similar) if guide is shown on a booking.
Any historical views: (e.g., reports).
(Replit: You will need to identify all relevant places where a User's name might be displayed based on their ID.)
Implement Display Logic: For each identified location:

The data coming from the backend query (getExperience, listExperiences, getBooking) will now include assignedGuides with guideUser that could be null or undefined if the users record was hard-deleted.
Modify the JSX/rendering logic to check for the presence of guideUser (or user object) before trying to display its properties (firstName, lastName).
If guideUser (or user object) is missing/null, display the placeholder text.
Proposed Code Changes:

You will need to analyze the frontend code to propose the exact diffs. The primary pattern will be:

Example Pattern (applying to all relevant components/files):

TypeScript

// BEFORE (Problematic):
<span>{assignedGuide.guideUser.firstName} {assignedGuide.guideUser.lastName}</span>
// OR
<span>{booking.assignedGuideUser.name}</span>

// AFTER (Proposed Fix - with null/undefined check):
<span>
  {assignedGuide.guideUser 
    ? `${assignedGuide.guideUser.firstName || ''} ${assignedGuide.guideUser.lastName || ''}`.trim() 
    : 'Deleted Guide'} {/* <--- ADD THIS CHECK */}
</span>
// OR
<span>
  {booking.assignedGuideUser 
    ? booking.assignedGuideUser.name 
    : 'Deleted User'} {/* <--- ADD THIS CHECK */}
</span>
(Replit: Please identify all necessary components and apply this pattern strategically.)

Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview that includes all modified frontend files.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this display fix):

The frontend correctly displays "Deleted User" or "Unassigned Guide" (or similar placeholder) in all relevant locations when a user_id exists in a relationship table but the corresponding users record is missing.
The display logic uses null/undefined checks (e.g., optional chaining ?. or conditional rendering) to prevent runtime errors.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
Emergency Protocols: (Same as Item 1.1 in overall plan)

I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This will complete the frontend display for deleted users!
