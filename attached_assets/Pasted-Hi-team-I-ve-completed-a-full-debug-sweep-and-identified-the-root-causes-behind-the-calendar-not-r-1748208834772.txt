Hi team — I’ve completed a full debug sweep and identified the root causes behind the calendar not rendering bookings correctly and showing inaccurate event titles.

🛠️ 1. Field Name Mismatch (Title Display Bug)
In CalendarPage.tsx, the booking object uses groupSize, but the calendar is referencing booking.guests.

Current (Buggy):

ts
Copy
Edit
const title = experience 
  ? `${experience.name} / ${customer?.lastName || 'Unknown'} / ${booking.guests || 0}`
Fix:

ts
Copy
Edit
const title = experience 
  ? `${experience.name} / ${customer?.lastName || 'Unknown'} / ${booking.groupSize || 0}`
This is why calendar events show “0” guests — the data exists but is being read from the wrong field.

🧩 2. Date Parsing Risk (Schema Update Impact)
After the schema change to timestamp(mode: 'date'), dates are stored in the database as pure dates (no time). The calendar may now misinterpret them due to outdated or unsafe parsing logic.

Ensure:

No use of new Date(string) without normalization

All event dates are parsed using a safe, timezone-neutral method, e.g.:

ts
Copy
Edit
const normalizeDate = (dateStr: string) => {
  const [y, m, d] = dateStr.split('-').map(Number);
  return new Date(y, m - 1, d);
};
This ensures that dates like 2025-06-22 render as June 22, not shifted to June 21/23 based on timezones.

✅ Success Criteria
Test Case	Expected Outcome
Booking created for June 22–24	Booking shows as June 22–24 in database, bookings tab, and calendar
Booking group size = 4	Calendar title says Experience / LastName / 4
Calendar loads	All valid bookings render with correct start/end dates
Timezone consistency	No visible shifts (+/-1 day) across system

🚨 Emergency Protocol (If Post-Fix Something Breaks)
If bookings disappear from calendar OR start showing wrong dates again, do the following:

Quick Revert:

Temporarily remove endAccessor logic and revert to raw booking.endDate to eliminate +1 day issues.

Fallback Parsing:

Revert normalizeDate to use:

ts
Copy
Edit
new Date(dateString + 'T00:00:00')
This forces safe midnight interpretation.

Notify Me Immediately:

I’ll help test and validate urgently.

✅ Action Items
 Replace booking.guests with booking.groupSize

 Verify calendar date parsing works with timestamp(mode: 'date')

 Confirm calendar shows all events accurately with correct date spans and titles

Let me know once it’s deployed — I’ll QA right away.

Thanks!
