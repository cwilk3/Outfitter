Excellent analysis! The root cause has been identified: a discrepancy where companyName is required in registerUser but not in authValidation.registerSchema.

Your task is to modify the Zod schema to enforce companyName as a required field. This will align the validation rules and allow valid sign-up attempts to proceed.

Specific Focus Area for Modification:

Locate the file: server/routes/auth.ts
Find the authValidation.registerSchema object.
Modify the registerSchema to include companyName as a required string field.
Proposed Code Changes:

File: server/routes/auth.ts
Location: Within the authValidation object, specifically inside the registerSchema definition.

Find this block (or similar, inside authValidation):

TypeScript

const authValidation = {
  // ... other schemas like loginSchema
  registerSchema: z.object({
    email: z.string().email('Invalid email address').min(1, 'Email is required'),
    password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters').max(100, 'Password must be less than 100 characters'),
    firstName: z.string().min(1, 'First name is required'),
    lastName: z.string().optional(),
    phone: z.string().optional(),
    role: z.enum(['admin', 'guide'], {
      invalid_type_error: "Role must be 'admin' or 'guide'"
    }).optional()
    // companyName is missing here or not required
  })
};
Replace it with (adding companyName as required):

TypeScript

const authValidation = {
  // ... other schemas like loginSchema
  registerSchema: z.object({
    email: z.string().email('Invalid email address').min(1, 'Email is required'),
    password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters').max(100, 'Password must be less than 100 characters'),
    firstName: z.string().min(1, 'First name is required'),
    lastName: z.string().optional(),
    phone: z.string().optional(),
    companyName: z.string().min(1, 'Company name is required'), // <--- ADDED/MODIFIED THIS LINE
    role: z.enum(['admin', 'guide'], {
      invalid_type_error: "Role must be 'admin' or 'guide'"
    }).optional()
  })
};
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this fix, please provide a comprehensive diff preview that includes:

The exact file path of the modified file (server/routes/auth.ts).
The approximate line numbers where the change occurred.
The current code block before your modification.
The modified code block after your change.
Success Criteria for My Approval:

The companyName field is correctly added to or modified within authValidation.registerSchema.
It is defined as a z.string().min(1, 'Company name is required') (or equivalent for making it a required string).
No other unrelated code lines are affected.
The change directly addresses the identified validation discrepancy by enforcing companyName at the Zod schema level.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met.
