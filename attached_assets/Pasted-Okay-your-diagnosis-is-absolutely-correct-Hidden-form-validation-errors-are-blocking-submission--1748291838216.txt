Okay, your diagnosis is absolutely correct. Hidden form validation errors are blocking submission.

We need to make these errors visible to debug the issue and improve the user experience.

Please modify the file `client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx`.

**Here are the specific changes:**

**Part 1: Add a `console.log` for validation errors at the start of `onSubmit`**

Locate the `onSubmit` function (around line 231). Inside `onSubmit`, **immediately after the `console.log('DEBUG: onSubmit - Function entered', { data });` line**, add the following `console.log` statement to inspect the `form.formState.errors` object:

```typescript
  console.log('DEBUG: onSubmit - Form validation errors:', form.formState.errors);
Part 2: Add FormMessage components to relevant FormFields

Go through the Form structure in PublicBooking.tsx and add a <FormMessage /> component directly below the <FormControl> for each FormField that handles user input. Focus on the fields from your bookingFormSchema.

Example for a text input field (e.g., firstName):
Find this pattern:

TypeScript

<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="firstName"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>First Name</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input placeholder="John" {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      {/* ADD FormMessage HERE */}
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
Change to:

TypeScript

<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="firstName"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>First Name</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input placeholder="John" {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage /> {/* ADDED THIS LINE */}
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
Apply this <FormMessage /> addition to the following FormField instances (and similar if there are others):

firstName
lastName
email
phone
guests
agreedToTerms (for this one, FormMessage usually goes under the Checkbox or Label within FormItem)
dateRange (this is handled by DateRangePicker internally, but if there's a FormField around it, ensure FormMessage can be placed there too).
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of these changes. I will review it carefully before you approve.

Success Criteria for my approval:

The console.log(form.formState.errors) is added at the specified location in onSubmit.
<FormMessage /> components are added within the FormItem for each listed FormField (and potentially others if they are direct user inputs).
No functional changes are made outside of adding these debugging/display elements.
I will not approve the change until these criteria are met.
