Okay, I understand. The previous console log confirms that the `onError` callback for `form.handleSubmit` has not yet been implemented in the code.

To finally capture the specific validation errors that `react-hook-form` is encountering when it blocks submission, we need to add this `onError` callback.

Please modify the file `client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx`.

Locate the `<form onSubmit={(event) => { ... return form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)(event); }}` tag (around line 637).

**We need to modify the `form.handleSubmit` call to include an `onError` callback as its second argument.** This `onError` callback will receive the validation errors.

**Change the `return form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)(event);` line within the form's `onSubmit` attribute as follows:**

**From:**
```typescript
<form onSubmit={(event) => {
  console.log('DEBUG: Form onSubmit event triggered', { eventType: event.type, defaultPrevented: event.defaultPrevented }); // NEW LOG 1
  return form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)(event); // THIS LINE CHANGES
}} className="space-y-6">
To:

TypeScript

<form onSubmit={(event) => {
  console.log('DEBUG: Form onSubmit event triggered', { eventType: event.type, defaultPrevented: event.defaultPrevented }); // Log 1
  return form.handleSubmit(
    onSubmit, // First argument: onSuccess callback
    (errors) => { // Second argument: onError callback
      console.error('DEBUG: form.handleSubmit - Validation FAILED, errors:', errors); // NEW CRITICAL DEBUG LOG
      // Optionally, you might want to show a toast here if validation fails
      // toast({
      //   title: "Form has errors",
      //   description: "Please check the highlighted fields.",
      //   variant: "destructive",
      // });
    }
  )(event);
}} className="space-y-6">
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of this change. I will review it carefully before you approve.

Success Criteria for my approval:

The form.handleSubmit call is modified to include the onError callback as its second argument.
The onError callback correctly logs the errors object.
No other code lines are affected.
I will not approve the change until these criteria are met.
