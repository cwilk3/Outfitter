You're redesigning the **booking page experience** for a SaaS platform called **Outfitter**, used by hunting and fishing outfitters. Customers (non-logged-in) use this public-facing page to book trips like "Bass Fishing" or "Elk Hunt."

---

## 🎯 GOAL

Reimagine the UI/UX of the public booking process to be **modern, smooth, and informative**. Begin with a **location picker**, and upon selecting a location, transition to a **Date Selection + Experience Overview** screen that presents all essential trip details pulled dynamically from the dashboard.

This redesign should:
- Feel **clean, modern, and mobile-friendly**
- Surface **everything the customer needs to know** before booking (without returning to another page)
- Be styled in a way that visually aligns with the rest of the app (clean white/dark green theme)

## ✅ BOOKING FLOW

### 1️⃣ LOCATION SELECTION (Step 1)
- A grid or list of available business locations (e.g., Kansas Fields, Oklahoma Lodge, Texas Ranch).
- Each location card should:
  - Display the name, city/state
  - Optional: Small photo or icon
- Once a location is selected, transition to the next step.

---

### 2️⃣ DATE SELECTION + EXPERIENCE DETAILS (Step 2)
When the user reaches this step, **display a full experience overview**, populated directly from the experience object created in the dashboard.

#### 🗂️ Layout: Split-screen or stacked layout
**Left Side (or top for mobile)** — Experience Details:
- Experience title (e.g., "Bass Fishing")
- Duration (e.g., 2 days)
- Max Capacity (e.g., Up to 3 people)
- Base Price per hunter (e.g., $250 / hunter)
- Rich description text
- Photo carousel or featured media
- List of included amenities (lodging, meals, equipment, etc.)
- Rules & safety info
- Location map or marker

**Right Side (or bottom for mobile)** — Calendar UI:
- Modern calendar picker (like `react-day-picker`)
- Automatically selects a full range based on duration
- Disabled start dates if full capacity is reached (backend-enforced)
- Displays selected dates and total price summary (based on selected hunters)

#### 👥 Hunter Count Selector:
- Inline control for selecting number of hunters (e.g., dropdown or stepper)
- Price should update dynamically (e.g., 2 hunters × $250 = $500)

---

### 3️⃣ DETAILS & BOOKING (Step 3)
Once dates are selected:
- Show confirmation of selected experience, location, dates, number of hunters, and total cost
- Capture name, phone, email, and optional notes
- "Book Now" button with subtle loading state

---

## 🎨 DESIGN STYLE

- Font: Clean, modern (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- Colors: Dark green, white, light grey background sections
- UI Patterns: Cards, shadowed panels, hover interactions
- Animations: Slide/fade transitions between steps, range selection highlight on calendar
- Mobile-First: Stacked layout on mobile, fluid transitions

---

## 🔌 TECH TIPS (optional React-based build)

- Pull experience data via backend API (`GET /experiences/:id`)
- Calendar: Use `react-day-picker` or `react-calendar` with custom range logic
- Store selections in local state or context (`location`, `experienceId`, `dates`, `hunters`)
- Use a global price calculator function based on:
  ```js
  totalPrice = pricePerHunter × numberOfHunters
