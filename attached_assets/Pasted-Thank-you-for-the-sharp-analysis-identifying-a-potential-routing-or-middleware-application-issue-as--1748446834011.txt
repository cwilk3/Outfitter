Thank you for the sharp analysis identifying a potential routing or middleware application issue as the core problem for GET /api/user-outfitters. We need to uncover the root cause of this route interception/masking.

Your primary task is to thoroughly investigate the application's router mounting chain, middleware application order, and any potential route conflicts that could be preventing GET /api/user-outfitters from correctly executing its intended handler with proper authentication context.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

Main Application Entry Point (e.g., server/index.ts or app.ts):

Examine how the main Express app is initialized.
Identify the order in which global middleware (like body parsers, cookie parsers, authentication middleware) are applied using app.use(...).
Crucially, examine how individual route files or routers (e.g., authRoutes, userRoutes, etc.) are imported and mounted using app.use('/api', someRouter) or similar. Pay close attention to the order of these mounts.
Authentication Middleware Application:

Verify where requireAuth and addOutfitterContext are defined and how they are typically applied to routes.
Is there any global or router-level application of requireAuth or addOutfitterContext that might be conditionally applied or misconfigured for /api/user-outfitters?
Route Definition for /api/user-outfitters:

Re-examine server/routes/index.ts (or wherever it's defined) to confirm its current structure and its relative position to other routes.
Potential Route Conflicts/Masking:

Search the entire server/ directory for any other files that might define a route that matches /api/user-outfitters or a more general pattern (e.g., /api/user/:id, /api/:resource). Pay special attention to:
Any _old or _disabled files (as routes_old_corrupted.ts.DISABLED was mentioned).
Files mounted with app.use that could intercept requests for /api/user-outfitters earlier in the chain.
Consider how your development server (e.g., Vite/Webpack dev server) might be handling /api/ requests and if it has any proxy rules that could be interfering.
Output Required for My Review (No Code Changes Yet):
Based on your investigation, please provide a detailed report outlining your findings. Answer the following questions:

Main Router Mounting Order: Describe the sequence of app.use() calls for main routers and middleware in your application's entry point.
Authentication Middleware Application Context: Explain how requireAuth and addOutfitterContext are generally applied (globally, per-router, per-route) and if there are any specific conditions.
Conflicting Route Definitions (if found): Detail any other route definitions that could potentially match or intercept GET /api/user-outfitters. Provide file paths and relevant code snippets.
Hypothesized Core Issue: Based on your findings, what is your most likely conclusion about why this specific route is being intercepted/masked?
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation phase):

A clear, concise report addressing all the bullet points above.
The report identifies the specific file(s) and code sections relevant to the router mounting and potential conflicts.
No code changes are proposed in this step; this is purely an investigative report.
This investigation is critical for understanding and resolving the architectural problem. I await your detailed report
