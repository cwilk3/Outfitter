Complete the Replit authentication implementation using a safe, incremental approach. Follow these exact steps in order:

Phase 0: Pre-Implementation Verification
0. Before starting, verify all required environment variables are present and correct

Test that the current dev system works perfectly (login, logout, all features)
Create a backup plan - document exactly how to revert each change
Confirm database schema is ready for multi-tenant data isolation
Phase 1: Enable Replit OAuth (Test First)

Create a test endpoint to verify Replit auth setup works
Enable only the /api/login route first
Test login flow works before proceeding
Enable /api/callback route and test
Only after both work, update /api/auth/user to use real auth
Keep dev auth as fallback during this phase
Phase 2: Data Isolation Implementation
7. Add outfitterId filtering to storage methods one table at a time

Add middleware to inject outfitterId from authenticated user
Update API endpoints to automatically scope queries by outfitterId
Test each change to ensure no data cross-pollution
Additional Safety Measures:

After each step, run the app and verify it still works completely
If any step breaks existing functionality, immediately revert and ask for guidance
Document what each change does before implementing it
Test with multiple user scenarios (admin, guide roles)
Verify data isolation by checking actual database queries include outfitterId filtering
Critical Stop Points:

If authentication setup fails, stop and debug before proceeding
If data shows up across outfitters, immediately halt and fix
If any existing feature breaks, revert the last change and reassess
Requirements:

Test each step before moving to next
Never break the working dev system until replacement is proven
Ask permission before any major changes
Stop immediately if any step fails and ask for guidance
End result: Fully functional multi-tenant app with real Replit authentication
Success criteria: Real Replit users can login, see only their outfitter's data, logout works perfectly, zero data cross-pollution between outfitters.
