Thank you for providing the detailed diff preview. The POST /api/experiences/:id/guides route is perfectly implemented and fully approved.

However, you have included two routes that were not requested in the previous prompt: GET /api/experiences/:id/guides and POST /api/experience-locations. We need to ensure we stick strictly to the requested changes to maintain control over the codebase.

Your primary task is to implement the approved POST /api/experiences/:id/guides route and explicitly remove the two unrequested routes.

Specific Actions to Perform:

Implement the POST /api/experiences/:id/guides Route:

Implement this route exactly as detailed in your "PROPOSED REPLACEMENT" block from the diff preview, including the assignGuideSchema definition.
Remove the Unrequested GET /api/experiences/:id/guides Route:

Remove the entire block for this route that you added in the diff preview. It starts with // GET /api/experiences/:id/guides - Get guides assigned to an experience and ends right before your approved POST route.
Remove the Unrequested POST /api/experience-locations Route:

Remove the entire block for this route that starts with // Experience-Location association routes (NEW - was missing!) and its handler.
Output Required for My Review:
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview for server/routes/experiences.ts that shows:

The addition of ONLY the approved POST /api/experiences/:id/guides route.
The removal of the two unrequested routes (GET /api/experiences/:id/guides and POST /api/experience-locations).
Success Criteria for My Approval:

The POST /api/experiences/:id/guides route is correctly added as specified in the previous approval.
The GET /api/experiences/:id/guides route (the unrequested one) is completely removed.
The POST /api/experience-locations route (the unrequested one) is completely removed.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This will ensure our codebase remains clean and exactly as approved.
