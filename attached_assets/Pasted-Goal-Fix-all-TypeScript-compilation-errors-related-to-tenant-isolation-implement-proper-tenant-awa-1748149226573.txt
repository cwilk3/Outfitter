Goal:
Fix all TypeScript compilation errors related to tenant isolation, implement proper tenant-aware database queries, and fully secure the vulnerable routes by enforcing outfitterId filtering.

Step-by-step Implementation Plan:

Review & Resolve TypeScript Interface Conflicts

Analyze the TS errors reported around storage interfaces and database query typings.

Adjust or extend interfaces and types so tenant filtering parameters (outfitterId) are included and correctly typed.

Ensure no type conflicts remain before proceeding.

Refactor Vulnerable Routes to Enforce Tenant Isolation

For each vulnerable route (bookings delete guide, dashboard update, guides delete assignment), modify SQL or ORM queries to include a WHERE outfitter_id = req.user.outfitterId condition.

Replace any direct data access without tenant filtering.

Maintain all authentication and authorization middleware as is.

Implement Unit and Integration Tests

Add tests that confirm:

Operations succeed only when the outfitterId matches the logged-in userâ€™s.

Operations fail or return 403/404 if tenant ID does not match.

Run existing tests to confirm no regressions.

Emergency Protocol in Code

Before your tenant checks and DB calls, retain an emergency patch that logs and blocks any suspicious or unfiltered access attempts.

Log detailed audit info for any blocked access.

Compile and Build

Compile the TypeScript codebase ensuring zero errors.

Build the project and confirm no runtime errors related to typings or tenant logic.

Manual Verification

Test all three previously vulnerable routes manually:

Confirm that actions succeed only for proper tenant.

Confirm cross-tenant operations are blocked.

Confirm no fallback to emergency patch is triggered on valid requests.

Remove Temporary Emergency Patches

After verification, remove the forced 403 emergency blocks.

Ensure routes function with proper tenant isolation intact.

Success Criteria for Review:

TypeScript compilation completes with no errors.

Tenant filtering applied in all vulnerable SQL/ORM queries.

Unit/integration tests validate tenant isolation.

Manual testing confirms routes behave as expected: allowed only for matching outfitterId.

Emergency blocks no longer triggered for valid tenant requests.

Clear audit logs are generated only for suspicious or blocked requests.

Emergency Protocol:

If any compilation or test failures occur during implementation, immediately revert to last known good commit with emergency patches active.

If any suspicious route access is detected during testing, logs must clearly identify the request and block further execution.

Keep backup of all code and database state before and after changes.

Notify immediately if any data integrity or tenant leakage issues appear.
