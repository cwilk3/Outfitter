Fantastic! Now that the pricing bug and the associated calendar/bookings tab issue are completely resolved, we need to clean up the temporary diagnostic logging that helped us pinpoint the problem.

Your task is to remove all the diagnostic logging related to the pricing bug from both the frontend and backend.

Specific Instructions:

1. File: client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx
Remove these console.log statements from the onSubmit function:
console.log('üîç [FRONTEND] Price calculation summary:', ...);
console.log('üîç [FRONTEND] Booking data being sent:', ...);
console.log('üîç [FRONTEND] Backend response received:', ...);
2. File: server/routes/public.ts
Remove all console.log statements that were added specifically for debugging the pricing bug. This includes (but is not limited to):
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] Raw request body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] Payment extraction:', ...);
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] Price calculation breakdown:', ...);
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] About to save to database:', ...);
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] Database booking created:', ...);
console.log('üîç [BACKEND] Final response preparation:', ...);
Any console.log that starts with [PUBLIC_BOOKING] if it was part of this temporary diagnostic set (e.g., console.log('[PUBLIC_BOOKING] Received booking request at ...');).
Ensure that the console.log for [ROUTE DEBUG] Booking request received - route version 2 ENHANCED is also removed, as it was part of this specific debugging phase.
Output Required for My Review:
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview that shows the removal of these specific diagnostic logs from both client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx and server/routes/public.ts.

Success Criteria for My Approval:

All high-verbosity diagnostic logs related to the pricing bug are removed from both frontend and backend files.
The functional logic of the booking flow (including the price calculation, routing, database interactions, and responses) remains completely intact and functional.
No other unrelated code lines are affected.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This cleanup ensures your code is production-ready
