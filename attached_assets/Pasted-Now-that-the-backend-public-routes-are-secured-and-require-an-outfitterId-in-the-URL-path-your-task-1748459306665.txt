Now that the backend public routes are secured and require an outfitterId in the URL path, your task is to update the frontend application to consume these new secure URLs.

Your primary goal is to modify the frontend to:

Extract the outfitterId from the URL path for the public booking pages.
Construct and use the new secure API URLs for locations, experiences, bookings, and v2/availability.
Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

Frontend Routing Configuration:

Locate the frontend routing file (e.g., client/src/App.tsx).
Update the route path for the public booking page to include :outfitterId (e.g., /public/:outfitterId).
Public Booking Page Component/Hook:

Identify the main component or hook responsible for rendering the public booking page and making API calls (e.g., client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx).
Extract outfitterId: Use the appropriate frontend routing hook (e.g., useParams from wouter as identified previously) to get the outfitterId from the URL.
Modify API Calls: Update all fetch or Axios calls for GET /api/public/locations, /api/public/experiences, /api/public/bookings, and GET /api/public/v2/availability to dynamically insert the extracted outfitterId into the URL.
Also update the POST API call for bookings to use the outfitterId in the URL.
Update Query Invalidation Keys: Ensure queryKey arrays for react-query (or similar) are updated to include outfitterId for proper caching and invalidation.
Please refer to the previously approved comprehensive diff preview for the exact code changes needed across:

client/src/App.tsx
client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx (all 6 changes within this file)
Output Required:
Once you have successfully implemented these frontend modifications, please confirm completion and indicate readiness for manual verification.

Success Criteria (as previously approved):

Frontend routing is updated to include :outfitterId for the public booking page (/public/:outfitterId).
The outfitterId is correctly extracted from the URL within client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx.
All four public GET API calls and the one public POST API call are updated to construct the URLs with the extracted outfitterId.
Query invalidation keys are updated to include outfitterId.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
The public booking pages will then be ready for manual testing to display data correctly filtered by the outfitterId in the URL.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. Please proceed with implementing these frontend changes.
