Thank you for confirming the plan. We are now systematically restoring the Experiences.tsx component after the rollback.

Your primary task is to add the missing state variable declarations in client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx to resolve any 'is not defined' compilation errors.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx
Location: Where useState declarations are typically made (early in the component function, e.g., around lines 200-210 from previous context).
Proposed Code Changes:

Find this block (where other useState declarations are, if present):

TypeScript

// Example: Existing useState declarations
const [selectedLocation, setSelectedLocation] = useState<Location | null>(null);
// ... other existing useState variables ...
Add these lines (or ensure they are present and correctly initialized, as these are known to be missing or causing issues after the rollback):

TypeScript

  const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1); // Essential for multi-step form
  const [isDialogOpen, setIsDialogOpen] = useState(false); // Essential for dialog control
  const [nextTempId, setNextTempId] = useState(1); // Essential for draft guides
  const [showAssignedOnly, setShowAssignedOnly] = useState(false); // Likely used for filtering UI
  const [selectedAddons, setSelectedAddons] = useState<any[]>([]); // Likely used for addon management
  const [draftGuides, setDraftGuides] = useState<DraftGuideAssignment[]>([]); // Essential for multi-guide state
(Replit: Please ensure all useState variables that are causing is not defined compilation errors are correctly declared and initialized here. The ones listed above are common ones found to be missing or causing issues in previous debugging phases).

Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented these modifications, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this surgical fix):

All useState variables that were causing compilation errors related to being 'not defined' are correctly declared and initialized.
The component compiles without errors (this will be confirmed after implementation).
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
Emergency Protocols:

If you see compilation errors after implementing, report the exact error and ask for specific fix approval.
If testing reveals issues, describe the problem and wait for instructions.
Never exceed the scope of what is explicitly requested.
Ask for permission before making any code modifications.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This is the first step to get Experiences.tsx compiling
