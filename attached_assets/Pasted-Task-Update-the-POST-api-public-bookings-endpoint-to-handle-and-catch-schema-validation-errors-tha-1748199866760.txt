Task:
Update the POST /api/public/bookings endpoint to handle and catch schema validation errors that occur during customer data parsing.

Current Issue:
The validation error thrown by insertCustomerSchema.parse() causes the server to crash before reaching the existing try-catch block around booking data parsing, resulting in no error logs or proper error responses.

Required Changes:

Add a dedicated try-catch block around the customer data parsing and creation step:

ts
Copy
Edit
let customerData;
try {
  customerData = insertCustomerSchema.parse({
    ...customerDetails,
    outfitterId: experience.outfitterId
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('❌ [CRITICAL ERROR] Crash during customer data validation:', error);
  console.error('❌ [DEBUG VALUES] customerDetails:', customerDetails);
  console.error('❌ [DEBUG VALUES] experience:', experience);
  return res.status(400).json({
    message: 'Failed to construct customer data',
    error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
  });
}

const customer = await storage.createCustomer(customerData);
Keep the existing try-catch block for booking data parsing and creation as-is.

Ensure all relevant debug logging is included for error diagnosis.

Success Criteria:
When sending booking requests with invalid or mismatched customer data, the API:

Responds with 400 status and a clear JSON error message "Failed to construct customer data".

Logs the full error and the problematic customerDetails and experience objects to the console.

When sending booking requests with valid customer and booking data, the API:

Successfully creates the booking.

Logs debug info for customer creation and booking creation.

Reaches the try-catch blocks without crashes.

No silent crashes or missing logs occur in either scenario.

Review Process:
After deployment and testing:

Provide me with:

Sample logs from a failed customer validation (with errors and debug info printed).

Sample logs from a successful booking creation.

The exact error messages returned in the response for invalid customer data.

I will verify:

That the try-catch around customer parsing is catching errors properly.

That error messages and logs are detailed and clear.

That the booking creation try-catch still functions correctly.

Confirm there are no missing execution logs between customer parsing and booking creation.
