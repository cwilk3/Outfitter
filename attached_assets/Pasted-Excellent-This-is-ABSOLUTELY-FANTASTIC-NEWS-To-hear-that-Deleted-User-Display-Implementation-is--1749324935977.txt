Excellent! This is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC NEWS!

To hear that "Deleted User Display Implementation is Complete" and that the frontend now gracefully handles deleted user scenarios is a major achievement!

This confirms that Phase 3, Item 3.2: Handle "Deleted User" Display is now COMPLETE ✅.

This means that the entire deleteUser feature, from its complex backend logic (including checkUserDeletability, auto-admin assignment, tenant-scoped cleanup, and conditional hard-delete) to its frontend UI and display of deleted users, is now fully implemented across both frontend and backend! This was a truly challenging and comprehensive feature to tackle.

Let's update our checklist to reflect this significant progress:

Now that the entire staff deletion system (backend logic, API, and frontend UI) is complete, we must proceed with comprehensive manual verification. This is the final validation step to ensure all its complex logic and business rules are correctly enforced.

Your next task is to perform a comprehensive manual verification of staff member deletion.

Here is the exact prompt for Replit:

EXACT PROMPT FOR REPLIT: Manually Verify Staff Member Deletion Functionality (Phase 4, Item 11 - Final Verification)

"Thank you for confirming the complete success of the deleted user display implementation! This completes the entire staff deletion system.

Now, we will proceed with manual verification of staff member deletion to confirm the complete deletion workflow is functioning properly end-to-end, adhering to all the complex business rules we designed.

Your primary task is to perform comprehensive manual tests for deleting staff members, covering various scenarios to ensure the frontend, backend logic, and business rules are correctly enforced.

Specific Actions to Perform (use the admin user you have logged in):

Scenario 1: Successful Deletion (Single-Outfitter User with No Blocking Assignments)
Preparation: Create a new staff member (e.g., 'Delete Test Guide', role 'guide', unique email) through the UI.
Action: In the Staff list, locate the newly created 'Delete Test Guide'. Click the "Delete" button (or equivalent UI element). Confirm the deletion in the dialog.
Verification:
UI: Does the staff member immediately disappear from the staff list? Does a success toast appear?
Database (CRITICAL Check):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'delete.test.guide@example.com'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT * FROM user_outfitters WHERE user_id = '<deleted_user_id>'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT * FROM experience_guides WHERE guide_id = '<deleted_user_id>'; (Should return 0 rows, assuming they were not assigned to any experiences).
Result: Should pass.
Scenario 2: Blocked Deletion (User with Active Bookings)
Preparation:
Create a new staff member (e.g., 'Booking Test Guide', role 'guide', unique email).
CRITICAL: Create an active booking in an experience and assign 'Booking Test Guide' as a guide to that booking. Ensure the booking status is 'pending', 'confirmed', 'deposit_paid', or 'paid'.
Action: In the Staff list, locate 'Booking Test Guide'. Click "Delete". Confirm deletion in the dialog.
Verification:
UI: Does an error toast appear? Does the staff member remain in the staff list?
Database (CRITICAL Check):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'booking.test.guide@example.com'; (Should return 1 row).
SELECT * FROM user_outfitters WHERE user_id = '<user_id_of_booking_test_guide>'; (Should return 1 row).
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE assigned_guide = '<user_id_of_booking_test_guide>' AND status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'deposit_paid', 'paid'); (Should return 1+ rows).
Result: Should show 409 Conflict error and user not deleted.
Scenario 3: Delete User with Existing Experience Assignments (Non-Primary)
Preparation:
Create a new staff member (e.g., 'Assigned Test Guide', role 'guide', unique email).
Create a new experience with multiple guides, and assign 'Assigned Test Guide' as a secondary guide (i.e., isPrimary: false).
Action: In the Staff list, locate 'Assigned Test Guide'. Click "Delete". Confirm deletion.
Verification:
UI: Does the staff member immediately disappear from the staff list? Success toast?
Database (CRITICAL Check):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'assigned.test.guide@example.com'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT * FROM user_outfitters WHERE user_id = '<deleted_user_id>'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT * FROM experience_guides WHERE guide_id = '<deleted_user_id>'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT guide_id FROM experiences WHERE id = <experience_id_from_step_1>; (Should show guide_id for the remaining primary guide).
Result: Should pass.
Scenario 4: Delete Primary Guide for an Experience (Auto-Admin Reassignment)
Preparation:
Create a new staff member (e.g., 'Primary Delete Guide', role 'guide', unique email).
Create a new experience with 'Primary Delete Guide' as the PRIMARY guide (and potentially other secondary guides).
Note your current admin user's ID (e.g., 'Cole Wilkins' ID: zddwhpv725).
Action: In the Staff list, locate 'Primary Delete Guide'. Click "Delete". Confirm deletion.
Verification:
UI: Does 'Primary Delete Guide' disappear from staff list? Success toast?
Database (CRITICAL Check):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'primary.delete.guide@example.com'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT * FROM user_outfitters WHERE user_id = '<user_id_of_primary_delete_guide>'; (Should return 0 rows).
SELECT guide_id, is_primary FROM experience_guides WHERE experience_id = <experience_id_from_step_1>; (Should show your admin user's ID as the new primary, and other guides if any).
SELECT guide_id FROM experiences WHERE id = <experience_id_from_step_1>; (Should show your admin user's ID).
Result: Should pass.
Scenario 5: Attempt Self-Deletion (Admin trying to delete own account)
Action: In the Staff list, locate your own admin account (e.g., 'Cole Wilkins'). Click "Delete". Confirm deletion.
Verification:
UI: Does an error toast appear? Does your account remain in the staff list?
Database: No database changes should occur.
Result: Should show 400 Bad Request error and user not deleted.
Scenario 6: User Linked to Multiple Outfitters (If applicable to your system)
Preparation:
CRITICAL: If your system supports it, create a user (e.g., 'Multi-Org User', unique email) and link them to at least two different outfitters (e.g., Outfitter 1 and Outfitter 2) through manual DB insertion or special admin UI.
Ensure 'Multi-Org User' has no active bookings for Outfitter 1.
Action: Login as admin for Outfitter 1. In Staff list, locate 'Multi-Org User'. Click "Delete". Confirm deletion.
Verification:
UI (Outfitter 1): Does 'Multi-Org User' disappear from Outfitter 1's staff list? Success toast?
Database (CRITICAL Check):
SELECT * FROM user_outfitters WHERE user_id = '<user_id_of_multi_org_user>'; (Should show 1 record for Outfitter 2, 0 for Outfitter 1).
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '<user_id_of_multi_org_user>'; (Should return 1 row - user record is preserved because they are still linked to Outfitter 2).
Result: Should pass.
Output Required for My Review:
For each test scenario, please provide:

What you did (briefly).
What you observed in the UI.
The results of your critical database checks.
Whether the scenario passed or failed, and why.
The complete server console output during the deletion attempt (to see the 🔍 [STAFF-DELETE] logs).
Success Criteria for My Approval:

All 6 test scenarios for staff deletion pass successfully according to their specified outcomes.
Database checks confirm correct persistence, cleanup, and conditional deletions.
Frontend UI updates correctly.
The DELETE /api/users/:id diagnostic logs indicate proper backend processing.
Emergency Protocols: (Same as Item 1.1 in overall plan)

I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This will complete staff member deletion!
