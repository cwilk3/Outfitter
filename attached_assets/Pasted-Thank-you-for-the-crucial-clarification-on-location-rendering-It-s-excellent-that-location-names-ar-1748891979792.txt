Thank you for the crucial clarification on location rendering. It's excellent that location names are displaying correctly as section headers. This means that particular issue is resolved.

Now, let's proceed to Phase 1, Item 1.3: Verify onSubmit Handler Refactor. This is vital to ensure our core multi-guide creation and update logic is correctly wired up.

Your primary task is to verify that the onSubmit handler in client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx has been refactored to correctly use createMutation.mutate() for new experiences and updateMutation.mutate() for existing experiences, and that it includes the assignedGuideIds array in its payload.

Specific Focus Areas for Verification:

File: client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx
Location: The const onSubmit = async (data: ExperienceFormValues) => { ... } function definition.
Output Required for My Review:
Please provide the complete and exact source code of the const onSubmit = async (data: ExperienceFormValues) => { ... }; block (including its definition and entire body) as it currently exists in your working environment.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this verification phase):

The provided onSubmit source code clearly shows it uses createMutation.mutate(data) for creation.
The provided onSubmit source code clearly shows it uses updateMutation.mutate({ id: experienceId, data }) for updates.
The createMutation's mutationFn payload is confirmed to include assignedGuideIds: draftGuides.map(...).
The updateMutation's mutationFn payload is confirmed to include assignedGuideIds: draftGuides.map(...).
The redundant manual for...of loop for guide processing is confirmed to be removed.
Dialog closing and success toasts are confirmed to be managed by the onSuccess handlers of createMutation/updateMutation in Experiences.tsx.
Appropriate diagnostic logs are present (as per the approved diff for onSubmit).
Emergency Protocols:

If you see compilation errors after providing the code, report the exact error and ask for specific fix approval.
If testing reveals issues, describe the problem and wait for instructions.
Never exceed the scope of what is explicitly requested.
Ask for permission before making any code modifications.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This verification is crucial for the multi-guide assignment feature!
