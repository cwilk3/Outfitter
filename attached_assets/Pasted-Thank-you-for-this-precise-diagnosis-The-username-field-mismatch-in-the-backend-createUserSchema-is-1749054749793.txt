Thank you for this precise diagnosis. The username field mismatch in the backend createUserSchema is a critical blocker.

Your primary task is to modify createUserSchema in server/routes.ts (or shared/schema.ts if it's a shared schema) to remove the username field requirement, aligning it with the frontend's payload.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: server/routes.ts (as you confirmed it's locally defined there in previous diffs)
Location: The createUserSchema definition.
Proposed Code Changes:

Find this block (the createUserSchema definition):

TypeScript

// Define a Zod schema for incoming user creation payload (UserFormValues)
const createUserSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(3, 'Username must be at least 3 characters'), // <--- REMOVE THIS LINE
  password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters'),
  firstName: z.string().min(2, 'First name is required'),
  lastName: z.string().min(2, 'Last name is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  phone: z.string().optional(),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'guide'], { message: 'Role must be admin or guide' }),
});
Replace it with (removing the username field):

TypeScript

// Define a Zod schema for incoming user creation payload (UserFormValues)
const createUserSchema = z.object({
  // username field removed
  password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters'),
  firstName: z.string().min(2, 'First name is required'),
  lastName: z.string().min(2, 'Last name is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  phone: z.string().optional(),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'guide'], { message: 'Role must be admin or guide' }),
});
(Replit: Ensure no other changes are made to the schema's structure or other fields.)

Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for server/routes.ts.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this compilation fix):

The username field is correctly removed from the createUserSchema definition in server/routes.ts.
The application compiles successfully (this will be confirmed after implementation).
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
Emergency Protocols: (Same as Item 1.1 in overall plan)

I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This will resolve the staff creation error!
