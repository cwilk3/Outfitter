You're building the booking interface for a hunting/fishing SaaS platform called **Outfitter**. This booking UI is used by customers (non-logged-in) on the public-facing booking page. 

---

## 🔧 GOAL

Replace the current "Start Date" and "End Date" fields with a **calendar view UI** that:
- Displays a calendar with **only available dates**.
- Automatically selects **the correct range of days** based on the experience duration once the customer clicks the first date.
- Prevents selecting any dates that overlap with already booked dates.
- Prevents double bookings at all times.

---

## ✅ FEATURES & RULES

### 🗓️ 1. CALENDAR SELECTION LOGIC
- Show a **monthly calendar view** (multi-month if possible).
- When a customer clicks a **start date**, the system should:
  - Automatically calculate the **end date** based on the experience's duration (e.g., 2 days, 3 days, etc.).
  - Visually highlight the entire selected date range.
  - Disable or grey out any unavailable or already-booked start dates.
  - Disable any date selections where the entire range cannot be accommodated.

### 📆 2. AVAILABILITY ENFORCEMENT
- Query available date ranges dynamically based on the experience data.
- Exclude any days that are already booked (check calendar availability data in the backend).
- Do not allow overlapping or partial date selections.
- Block out any past dates or unavailable windows.

### 🔗 3. UX FLOW
- After selecting a valid date range, allow the user to continue to the next step (Details → Contact Info → Booking).
- Display the full selected date range and duration summary below the calendar.
- If the selected start date does not allow for the full duration (due to limited availability), prevent selection and show a tooltip or small message like “Not enough available days for this experience.”

### 🧩 UI/UX STYLE
- Match current dark-green/white aesthetic as seen in the reference screenshot.
- Use clean hover states and range highlighting.
- Prefer a mobile-friendly calendar component (e.g., `react-day-picker` or similar).
- Display a subtle animation when the date range is confirmed.

## 📦 TECH HINTS (Optional if building in React)
- Use a calendar library like:
  - `react-day-picker` with `disabledDays` and `selectedRange`
  - or `react-calendar` with `tileDisabled`
- Pull `experience.duration` and `availableDates[]` from the backend API.
- Once the user clicks a date:
  - Check if the following `N` days are available (`N = duration`).
  - Highlight range if valid, else show error/tooltip.

---

## ✅ END RESULT

A slick, intuitive **calendar-based booking step** that:
- Auto-selects correct ranges
- Prevents double bookings
- Enhances the customer experience
- Fully aligns with the current visual style
