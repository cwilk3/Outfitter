Let's implement a guide assignment feature for our Outfitter application that allows administrators to assign guides to experiences during both creation and editing.

The complete flow should include:
Admin creates guide users with the 'guide' role in the system
These guide users are available for selection when assigning guides to experiences
Admin can assign multiple guides to an experience
Admin can set one guide as the primary guide
Guide assignment happens during Step 5 'Add-ons & Guides' of the experience creation/editing flow. Make ‘Review’ standalone in Step 6.
Guide assignment works during both initial experience creation and when editing existing experiences
Once guides are assigned to experiences, these experiences automatically appear in the respective guide's dashboard view

The feature needs:
UI components for selecting and managing guides
All necessary backend APIs and storage functions
Clear data flow from guide creation to guide selection
Guide-specific views to see assigned experiences
Integration with the existing multi-step form, specifically in the 'Add-ons & Guides' step

Technical requirements:
Database schema updates in shared/schema.ts to properly define guide-experience relationships
Storage interface updates in server/storage.ts to handle guide assignment operations
API route updates in server/routes.ts to expose guide management endpoints
Frontend components in client/src/components/ui/ for guide selection and management
Form state handling to properly save and retrieve guide assignments
Proper transaction handling for experience creation that includes guide assignments
Helper functions to convert between data types if needed

When implementing, please be especially careful with:
Type consistency between frontend and backend - guide IDs should be consistently treated as strings throughout the entire flow
Proper handling of the experience ID during creation when it doesn't exist yet
Clear separation between the creation flow component (ExperienceGuideSelector) and editing flow component (ExperienceGuides)
Proper error handling and validation for guide assignments
Filter mechanisms so guides only see experiences they're assigned to
Ensuring guide selection integrates properly with the add-ons stage of the form
Handling the state during multi-step form completion, especially for newly created guides
Proper error handling for cases where guides might be deleted but still referenced
Handling the case where a primary guide is removed (should assign a new primary guide if available)
Optimistic UI updates for better user experience during guide assignment changes

Previous implementation issues included type mismatches between string and number IDs, inconsistent handling of IDs between components, and problems with the ID generation mechanism for guide assignments. Please ensure these are addressed in the new implementation.
