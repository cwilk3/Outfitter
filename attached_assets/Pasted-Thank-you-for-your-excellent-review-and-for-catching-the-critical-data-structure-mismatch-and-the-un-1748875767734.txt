Thank you for your excellent review and for catching the critical data structure mismatch and the unverified backend route. You are absolutely correct to raise these concerns.

Your primary task is to definitively verify if the POST /api/experiences/:id/guides endpoint is correctly persisting guide assignments to the database, as this endpoint is currently being called by the frontend's loop.

Specific Actions to Perform:

Reproduce the Frontend Call:

Go to client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx and temporarily re-enable the for (const guide of draftGuides) loop (Lines 1244-1285 approximate) that processes guides after experience creation. This loop currently uses fetch to POST /api/experiences/{id}/guides for each guide.
This is only for debugging; we will remove it later.
Perform a manual test: Create a new experience and assign multiple guides (e.g., 2 guides) through the frontend UI.
Verify Backend Persistence (Database Check):

After the frontend completes its processing (and you get the success toast, dialog closes etc.), query your database to confirm the assigned guides.
SQL Query: Find the experience_id of the newly created experience.
SELECT * FROM experience_guides WHERE experience_id = <new_experience_id>;
SELECT guide_id FROM experiences WHERE id = <new_experience_id>; (for compatibility check)
Capture Console Output:

Capture the complete frontend console logs.
Capture the complete backend server logs.
Output Required for My Review:
Please provide:

Confirmation that the for...of loop in client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx was temporarily re-enabled.
The exact experience_id of the newly created experience.
The exact raw database results from the SELECT * FROM experience_guides query for that experience_id.
The exact raw database results from the SELECT guide_id FROM experiences query for that experience_id.
The complete frontend console output during the creation attempt.
The complete backend server console output during the creation attempt.
A clear statement on whether the POST /api/experiences/:id/guides endpoint successfully persisted multiple guides to the database.
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this verification phase):

All requested logs and database results are provided.
A clear conclusion is drawn on the persistence of the individual POST calls.
No permanent code changes are proposed in this step; this is purely a verification report.
This verification is crucial to decide the final approach for multi-guide creation. I await your detailed report.
