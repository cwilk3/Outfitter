Thank you for identifying these technical setup challenges with the newly created test files. I understand that import paths, mock typing, and test infrastructure setup are common issues when integrating code into an existing project.

Your primary task is to fix these technical issues to make the comprehensive test suite (unit tests for server/storage.ts and integration tests for server/routes/experiences.ts) fully runnable and functional.

Specific Actions to Perform:

Resolve Import Paths: Correct all import statements in the test files (client/src/App.tsx, client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx, etc.) to match your actual project's structure and module resolution (e.g., using correct relative paths or @shared aliases as per your tsconfig.json).
Adjust Mock Implementations and Typing:
Ensure that Jest mocks for database interactions (db, storage functions) and other dependencies (e.g., generateToken) correctly match your project's interfaces and types.
Properly type any mock return values to avoid TypeScript errors.
Configure Test Infrastructure for Integration Tests:
Determine the correct way to import and set up your Express application instance (app) for Supertest integration tests.
Set up proper authentication mocking for the route tests. This might involve mocking your requireAuth and addOutfitterContext middleware, or providing a way to inject valid test tokens and user objects (req.user, req.outfitterId) into test requests.
Output Required for My Review:

Once you have successfully resolved these technical issues and the tests are runnable:

Provide a comprehensive diff preview of all modified test files (e.g., tests/server/storage.test.ts, tests/server/routes/experiences.test.ts, or any other test utility files you needed to create/modify). This diff should show how you fixed the import paths, mock typing, and test setup.
Report the complete results of running the entire test suite. This should clearly indicate a PASS or FAIL for each individual test case we outlined previously.
Success Criteria for My Approval:

All test files are free of import errors and typing issues.
The tests are fully runnable within your environment.
The diff preview clearly shows the fixes to the test setup (imports, mocks, infrastructure).
A complete report of the test results is provided, indicating success for all relevant test cases.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. Please proceed with fixing these technical issues to make the tests runnable.
