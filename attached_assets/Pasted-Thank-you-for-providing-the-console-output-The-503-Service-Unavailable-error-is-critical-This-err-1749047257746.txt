Thank you for providing the console output. The 503 Service Unavailable error is critical.

This error indicates that the application's server process is not running or is not accessible when the frontend is attempting to make API calls. This is an environmental/deployment issue within Replit, not a bug in your code.

Your primary task is to ensure your Replit application is actively running and deployed.

Specific Actions to Perform:

Check Replit Console: Look at your Replit workspace.
Is the server process actively running (e.g., green dot, console output showing server listening on a port)?
If it's stopped, click the "Run" button to start it.
Verify Deployment (if applicable): If your Replit project uses an "Always On" or "Deploy" feature for external accessibility, ensure it's active and not sleeping.
Perform a Full Restart: If unsure, try a complete restart of your Replit project (stop the current run, then click "Run" again).
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have confirmed your application is running correctly:

Confirm the application server is now actively running (e.g., "Server listening on port XXXX" in the console).
Then, immediately attempt to create a new staff member again through the frontend UI.
Provide the complete server console output from this new staff creation attempt (we are looking for our üîç [STAFF-CREATE] logs now).
Success Criteria for My Approval:

The application server is confirmed to be running.
The 503 error is resolved.
A clear console output for the staff creation attempt is provided, showing if our POST /api/users route and its diagnostics are hit.
Emergency Protocols:

If you see any new, different compilation errors, report the exact error and ask for specific fix approval.
If testing reveals issues after the server is running, describe the problem and wait for instructions.
Never exceed the scope of what is explicitly requested.
Ask for permission before making any code modifications.
CRITICAL DISRUPTION PROTOCOL (Active): If, during implementation, you identify that a proposed change (or the only way to implement it) will disrupt, break, or require significant re-work in other, seemingly unrelated areas of the platform, you must stop immediately. Report your findings, explain the potential disruption, and await explicit approval for how to proceed, even if it delays the current task.
I will not approve further steps until the application is confirmed running and we can properly test staff creation.
