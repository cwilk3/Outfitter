Thank you for this crystal-clear diagnosis. The root cause of the guide replacement issue is confirmed: externalAssignedGuides is not being properly passed to ExperienceGuides.

Your primary task is to modify client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx to correctly pass the assignedGuides array (from the selectedExperience object) to the ExperienceGuides component via its assignedGuides prop.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx
Location: Where the ExperienceGuides component is rendered (you will need to locate this in the JSX, based on previous diffs around line 2121 or within the form).
Proposed Code Changes:

Find this block (where ExperienceGuides component is rendered):

TypeScript

<ExperienceGuides
  experienceId={selectedExperience?.id || 0}
  readOnly={false}
  draftMode={!selectedExperience?.id} // Correctly determines draft mode
  initialDraftGuides={draftGuides} // For creation mode, should be initialized correctly
  onChange={(guides) => { /* ... existing onChange logic ... */ }}
  // assignedGuides prop is missing or empty here
/>
Replace it with (adding assignedGuides prop):

TypeScript

<ExperienceGuides
  experienceId={selectedExperience?.id || 0}
  readOnly={false}
  draftMode={!selectedExperience?.id}
  initialDraftGuides={draftGuides}
  onChange={(guides) => { /* ... existing onChange logic ... */ }}
  assignedGuides={selectedExperience?.assignedGuides || []} // <--- CRITICAL: Pass existing assigned guides
/>
(Replit: Ensure selectedExperience is correctly populated with assignedGuides data from the backend query, which was part of our Phase 2 update. If selectedExperience.assignedGuides is still not populated, you might need to adjust the query that fetches selectedExperience to include with: { experienceGuides: { with: { user: true } } } similar to getExperience/listExperiences in server/storage.ts if selectedExperience comes from a fresh fetch/query here.)

Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this functional fix):

The ExperienceGuides component is correctly passed the assignedGuides prop, sourced from selectedExperience?.assignedGuides.
The selectedExperience object is confirmed to be populated with assignedGuides data from its API source.
The change directly resolves the externalAssignedGuides being empty, which will allow draftGuides to correctly initialize with existing guides.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. This fix is crucial for solving the guide replacement issue!
