Thank you for diagnosing this persistent issue. The problem is clear: the 'Make Primary' button is not triggering the updateGuideMutation.mutate() call, resulting in no backend logs.

Your primary task is to implement highly targeted diagnostic logging at the very beginning of the onClick handler for the 'Make Primary' button in client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx
Locate "Make Primary" Button: Find the rendering of the "Make Primary" button within the component's JSX (look for the assignedGuides.map section, similar to the "X" button).
Add Diagnostic Logging: Place console.log statements at the absolute beginning of the onClick handler's arrow function, and log relevant context.
Proposed Code Changes (applying to experience-guides.tsx):

Find this block (the "Make Primary" button's onClick handler):

TypeScript

// Look for a Button or similar element with text "Make Primary" or an icon for it.
// Example structure:
<Button
  // ... other props
  onClick={() => { // <--- ADD LOGS HERE
    // Logic to set primary
    // updateGuideMutation.mutate({ id: assignment.id, isPrimary: true });
  }}
  // ... other props
>
  Make Primary
</Button>
Replace it with (adding diagnostic logs at the very start of the onClick function):

TypeScript

<Button
  // ... other props
  onClick={() => { // <--- ADD LOGS HERE
    // --- START NEW ONCLICK DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING FOR MAKE PRIMARY ---
    console.log('--- DIAGNOSTIC: Make Primary Button onClick Handler Called ---');
    console.log('üîç [PRIMARY_ONCLICK_DEBUG] Assignment object passed:', JSON.stringify(assignment, null, 2));
    console.log('üîç [PRIMARY_ONCLICK_DEBUG] current draftMode:', draftMode);
    console.log('üîç [PRIMARY_ONCLICK_DEBUG] current experienceId:', experienceId);
    // --- END NEW ONCLICK DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING FOR MAKE PRIMARY ---
    
    // Original logic to set primary
    // updateGuideMutation.mutate({ id: assignment.id, isPrimary: true });
  }}
  // ... other props
>
  Make Primary
</Button>
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx. After approval, you will perform a "Make Primary" attempt and provide the complete browser console output.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this diagnostic phase):

The console.log statements with üîç [PRIMARY_ONCLICK_DEBUG] prefix are correctly added at the very beginning of the "Make Primary" button's inline onClick handler.
The logs correctly capture the assignment object, draftMode, and experienceId.
No other unrelated functional code lines are affected.
The purpose is solely diagnostic; no functional fix is expected from this specific diff.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. This logging is crucial to understand if the button click is even reaching our code.
