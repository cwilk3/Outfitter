Excellent! Now that the registration bug is completely resolved and the system is functional, it's time to clean up the temporary diagnostic logging we implemented.

Your task is to remove all the ultra-granular debug logging from the registerUser function in server/emailAuth.ts. Retain only essential high-level operational logs.

Specific Instructions:

File: server/emailAuth.ts
Function: registerUser
Remove all console.log statements that were added specifically for debugging the ReferenceError and req.body parsing, including but not limited to:

console.log('Enter registerUser function. req.body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
console.log('--- START of Registration Handler ---');
console.log('Initial req.body received:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
console.log('Request body received:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2)); (the one inside the try block before the initial if (!email || ...) check)
console.log('Validation check - email:', !!email, ...);
console.log('Validation failed - missing fields:', ...);
All [DEBUG] prefixed logs (e.g., [DEBUG] Pre-User Creation, [DEBUG] Post-User Creation, [DEBUG] CRITICAL: newUser is null or undefined, [DEBUG] Approaching token generation, [DEBUG] Token generated, [DEBUG] Cookie set, [DEBUG] About to destructure newUser, [DEBUG] userResponse after destructuring, [DEBUG] Success response sent, [DEBUG] CRITICAL LOGIC ERROR:).
Retain the following existing high-level logs:

console.log('REGISTER FUNCTION CALLED'); (if you believe this is useful for general flow tracking)
console.log('=== REGISTRATION DEBUG START ==='); (if you want to keep this as a general entry point marker, though it was part of debug originally)
console.log('Hashing password...');
console.log('Password hashed successfully');
console.log('Creating user with data:', { ... }); (the high-level one, consider removing the password hash part)
console.log('âœ… Created user-outfitter relationship successfully:', userOutfitter);
The console.error statements within the catch blocks for actual error reporting.
Output Required for My Review:
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of the changes in server/emailAuth.ts, showing the removal of these specific diagnostic logs.

Success Criteria for My Approval:

All ultra-granular [DEBUG] logs and temporary req.body inspection logs are removed from registerUser.
Only essential, high-level operational logs (as discussed) remain.
The functional logic of the registerUser function (variable declarations, assignments, if (newUser && outfitter) block, token generation, cookie setting, response) remains completely untouched and functional.
No other unrelated code lines are affected.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met."
