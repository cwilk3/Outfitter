DETAILED ANALYSIS: "Deer Hunt - TX" Experience Creation Issue

Looking at the logs for the "Deer Hunt - TX" experience creation, here's my comprehensive diagnosis:

‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS:
Experience Creation: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Experience ID 4 created successfully with proper data
Authentication: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - User authenticated with outfitterId: 1 throughout the process
Guide Fetching: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - All guide requests return successfully (empty arrays, which is expected)
‚ùå ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Primary Issue: "Error handling add-ons for new experience: {}"

Detailed Diagnosis:

1. Frontend Route Call Pattern:
Frontend logs show: "Checking existing add-ons for the new experience ID 4"
This indicates the frontend is attempting to fetch add-ons after creating the experience
The error occurs in the add-ons handling step, not the experience creation itself
2. Authentication Pipeline:
Working Correctly: All authentication logs show successful token verification
User Context: Proper outfitterId (1) maintained throughout all requests
No Auth Failures: No 401 or authentication-related errors in the server logs
3. Network Request Analysis:
Missing Server Logs: I don't see any corresponding server logs for /api/experiences/4/addons requests
Frontend Error: Empty error object {} suggests a network or parsing issue
Silent Failure: The request is failing before reaching the server or the response is malformed
4. Timing Analysis:
Experience created at: 12:41:13 PM
Guide fetching successful: 12:41:16 PM (multiple successful requests)
Gap: No add-ons request appears in server logs despite frontend attempting it
üéØ MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE:
Frontend Route Mismatch Still Persists - Despite my earlier fix, there may be additional places in the code where the frontend is still calling the old /api/experience-addons/4 route instead of the corrected /api/experiences/4/addons route.

üîç SPECIFIC EVIDENCE:
Server Logs Missing: No /api/experiences/4/addons request appears in server logs
Empty Error Object: {} suggests a fetch error or network issue, not a server response
Successful Parallel Requests: Guide fetching works perfectly, indicating auth and networking are functional
Consistent Pattern: Same issue occurred with previous experiences (ID 2, 3)
üí° CONCLUSION:
The issue is NOT with:

Authentication (working perfectly)
Server-side routes (would show in logs if reached)
Database operations (experience creation succeeds)
Tenant isolation (properly maintained)
The issue IS with:

Frontend making requests to non-existent or incorrectly configured route
Possible multiple locations in frontend code still using old route pattern
Network/fetch error causing silent failure with empty error object
Next Action Needed: Comprehensive search of frontend codebase for all instances of /api/experience-addons/ to ensure complete route pattern correction.
