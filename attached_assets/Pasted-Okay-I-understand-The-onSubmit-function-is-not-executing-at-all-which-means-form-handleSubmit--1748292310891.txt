Okay, I understand. The `onSubmit` function is not executing at all, which means `form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)` is not being invoked. This is a critical blocking issue.

We need to trace the event more precisely.

Please modify the file `client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx`.

**Here are the specific changes:**

**Part 1: Add a debug log directly to the `<form>` element's `onSubmit` handler**

Locate the `<form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} ...>` tag (around lines 635-636).
**Change the `onSubmit` attribute to include an immediate `console.log`:**

**From:**
```typescript
<form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-6">
To:

TypeScript

<form onSubmit={(event) => {
  console.log('DEBUG: Form onSubmit event triggered', { eventType: event.type, defaultPrevented: event.defaultPrevented }); // NEW LOG 1
  return form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)(event);
}} className="space-y-6">
Part 2: Add a debug log to the "Complete Booking" button's onClick handler

Locate the <Button type="submit" ...> for "Complete Booking" (around lines 1126-1128).
Add an onClick handler to this button to log its click, ensuring it does not interfere with type="submit":

From:

TypeScript

<Button type="submit" className="flex-1">
  Complete Booking
</Button>
To:

TypeScript

<Button
  type="submit"
  className="flex-1"
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('DEBUG: Complete Booking button clicked'); // NEW LOG 2
  }}
>
  Complete Booking
</Button>
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of these changes. I will review it carefully before you approve.

Success Criteria for my approval:

The <form> element's onSubmit attribute is modified to include the console.log as specified.
The "Complete Booking" <Button> element's onClick attribute is added with the console.log as specified.
No other code lines are affected.
I will not approve the change until these criteria are met.

After approval and implementation, you will need to:

Restart your frontend application.
Click "Complete Booking".
Immediately provide the complete output from your browser's developer console and a screenshot of the Network tab. These logs will be crucial.
