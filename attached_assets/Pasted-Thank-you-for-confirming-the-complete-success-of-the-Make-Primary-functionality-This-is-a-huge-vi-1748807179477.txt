Thank you for confirming the complete success of the 'Make Primary' functionality! This is a huge victory.

Now, let's clean up all the temporary diagnostic logging we added related to the guide assignment, unassignment, and 'Make Primary' features.

Your primary task is to remove all console.log statements from both frontend and backend files that were added specifically for debugging these guide management features.

Specific Instructions:

1. File: client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx
Remove all console.log statements that start with:
🔍 [FRONTEND_ASSIGN_DEBUG]
🔍 [FRONTEND_UNASSIGN_DEBUG]
🔍 [MUTATION_FN_DEBUG]
🔍 [FETCH_DEBUG] (if any remain)
🔍 [API_REQUEST_DEBUG] (if any remain here, otherwise from queryClient.ts)
❌ [MUTATION_FN_DEBUG]
❌ [MUTATION_ERROR]
🔄 [FRONTEND_UNASSIGN_SUCCESS]
⚡ [OPTIMISTIC_UPDATE]
⚡ [OPTIMISTIC_ROLLBACK]
🔍 [ON_SUCCESS_UI_DEBUG]
🔍 [PRIMARY_ONCLICK_DEBUG]
--- DIAGNOSTIC: X Button onClick Handler Called ---
--- DIAGNOSTIC: Make Primary Button onClick Handler Called ---
🔄 [UPDATE_GUIDE_MUT_SUCCESS]
❌ [UPDATE_GUIDE_MUT_ERROR]
2. File: server/routes.ts
Remove all console.log statements that start with:
--- DIAGNOSTIC: GET /api/users Role Filtering ---
🔍 [API_USERS_DEBUG]
3. File: server/routes/guides.ts
Remove all console.log statements that start with:
--- DIAGNOSTIC: PUT /api/experience-guides/:id ---
🔍 [PRIMARY_PERSIST_DEBUG]
❌ [PRIMARY_PERSIST_ERROR]
✅ [PRIMARY_PERSIST_DEBUG]
4. File: server/storage.ts
Remove all console.log statements that start with:
--- DIAGNOSTIC: getUsersByOutfitterId Query ---
🔍 [GET_USERS_DB_DEBUG]
--- DIAGNOSTIC: updateGuideAssignment Storage Function ---
🔍 [STORAGE_PERSIST_DEBUG]
❌ [STORAGE_PERSIST_ERROR]
