Thank you for diagnosing the draftMode issue. The problem is clear: the ExperienceGuides component is incorrectly being set to draftMode because the isCreating variable itself is evaluating to true when editing an existing experience.

Your primary task is to investigate the logic that determines the value of the isCreating variable in client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx and implement a fix to ensure it accurately reflects whether the user is creating a new experience or editing an existing one.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

File: client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx
Locate isCreating: Find where the isCreating variable is declared and how its value is derived. It might be:
Based on a URL parameter (e.g., /experiences/new vs. /experiences/:id).
Based on the presence of selectedExperience state or prop.
A direct useState variable that's not being updated correctly.
Add Diagnostic Logging: Temporarily add console.log statements to trace isCreating's value.
Log isCreating immediately after its declaration.
Log the value of any variables or conditions used to determine isCreating.
Proposed Code Changes:

You will need to analyze the Experiences.tsx file to propose the exact diff. The fix will involve ensuring isCreating is true only when a new experience is being created, and false when an existing experience is being edited.

Output Required for My Review:
Based on your investigation, please provide:

A detailed report outlining your findings:
How isCreating is currently determined.
Why it's incorrect when editing.
Relevant code snippets from client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx.
A proposed diff preview of the code changes to correctly set isCreating.
Proposed diagnostic logging (to be included in the diff) to confirm the fix's behavior.
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation and proposed fix phase):

The root cause of isCreating being incorrect is clearly identified.
The proposed diff correctly modifies the logic to determine isCreating.
isCreating will be true only for new experiences and false for existing experiences.
Diagnostic logging is included to verify the fix.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
I will not approve further steps until these criteria are met. This fix is crucial for the ExperienceGuides component to operate in the correct mode
