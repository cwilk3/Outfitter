Thank you for confirming the complete success of the guide assignment functionality! This is a tremendous achievement.

Now, let's address the new errors you're noticing regarding deleting or unassigning guides from an experience. This is crucial for full guide management.

Enter "Edit" mode for that experience.
Attempt to "Clear" or "Unassign" the guide (or select a "No Guide" option if available).
Save/Update the experience.
Capture Diagnostic Information:
