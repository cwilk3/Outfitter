Thank you for the updated analysis and proposed next steps. Given the persistence of the ReferenceError despite the apparent correct scoping of newUser and outfitter, it's critical we investigate the generateToken function itself.

Your primary task is to investigate the generateToken function to confirm it is properly imported, defined, and accessible at the point of its call in server/emailAuth.ts (specifically around line 239).

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

Locate the definition of generateToken. Where is this function actually declared?
Verify its export: If generateToken is defined in a separate file, confirm it is correctly exported from that file.
Verify its import: In server/emailAuth.ts, confirm that generateToken is correctly imported from its definition file. Look for an import { generateToken } from '...' statement.
Check its signature: Briefly review the function signature of generateToken to ensure it expects the arguments (user object, outfitterId) that are being passed to it.
Output Required for My Review (No Code Changes Yet):
Based on your investigation, please provide a detailed report answering the following questions:

File where generateToken is defined: [e.g., server/utils/auth.ts]
Is generateToken correctly exported from its definition file? [Yes/No, with relevant export statement if found]
Is generateToken correctly imported into server/emailAuth.ts? [Yes/No, with the exact import statement if found]
What is the function signature of generateToken? [e.g., function generateToken(user: User, outfitterId: number): string]
Any other observations: Any other findings regarding generateToken's accessibility or potential issues that might cause a ReferenceError at its call site.
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation phase):

A clear, concise report addressing all the bullet points above.
No code changes are proposed in this step; this is purely an investigative report.
I will not approve any further functional changes until this investigation is complete and reported to me.
