Thank you for the update. The contradiction (inline logic supposedly running but logs not appearing) indicates a persistent issue. We need to verify if the onClick handler itself is firing and what data it receives.

Your primary task is to add highly targeted diagnostic logging at the very beginning of the inline onClick handler for the "X" (remove guide) button in client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx
Location: The very first lines inside the onClick={() => { ... }} arrow function, before any conditional logic.
Proposed Code Changes:

Find this block (the onClick handler in the Button component):

TypeScript

<Button
  variant="destructive"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => { // <--- ADD LOGS INSIDE THIS ARROW FUNCTION
    if (draftMode) {
      // In draft mode, remove from local state
      const updatedDraftGuides = draftGuides.filter(guide => guide.tempId !== assignment.tempId);
      // ... rest of draftMode logic ...
    } else {
      // In normal mode, call API and update state
      removeGuideMutation.mutate({
        experienceId: experienceId!,
        guideId: assignment.guideId
      }, {
        onSuccess: () => {
          // ... onSuccess logic ...
        }
      });
    }
  }}
  disabled={!draftMode && removeGuideMutation.isPending}
>
  <X className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
Replace it with (adding diagnostic logs at the very start of the onClick function):

TypeScript

<Button
  variant="destructive"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => { // <--- ADD LOGS HERE
    // --- START NEW ONCLICK DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING ---
    console.log('--- DIAGNOSTIC: X Button onClick Handler Called ---');
    console.log('üîç [ONCLICK_DEBUG] Assignment object passed:', JSON.stringify(assignment, null, 2));
    console.log('üîç [ONCLICK_DEBUG] current draftMode:', draftMode);
    console.log('üîç [ONCLICK_DEBUG] current experienceId:', experienceId);
    // --- END NEW ONCLICK DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING ---

    if (draftMode) {
      // In draft mode, remove from local state
      const updatedDraftGuides = draftGuides.filter(guide => guide.tempId !== assignment.tempId);
      // ... rest of draftMode logic ...
    } else {
      // In normal mode, call API and update state
      removeGuideMutation.mutate({
        experienceId: experienceId!,
        guideId: assignment.guideId
      }, {
        onSuccess: () => {
          // ... onSuccess logic ...
        }
      });
    }
  }}
  disabled={!draftMode && removeGuideMutation.isPending}
>
  <X className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for client/src/components/ui/experience-guides.tsx. After approval, you will perform a new test (attempting to remove a guide) and provide the complete console output from these new logs.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this diagnostic phase):

The console.log statements with üîç [ONCLICK_DEBUG] prefix are correctly added at the very beginning of the inline onClick handler.
The logs correctly capture the assignment object, draftMode, and experienceId.
No other unrelated functional code lines are affected.
The purpose is solely diagnostic; no functional fix is expected from this specific diff.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. This logging is crucial to understand if the button click is even reaching our code.
