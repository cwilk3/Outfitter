Thank you for confirming the sign-up validation bug. It's crucial we get this resolved so we can proceed with onboarding and testing.

Your task is to thoroughly investigate and fix the server-side validation logic for the user registration/sign-up route.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

Locate the exact file and function responsible for handling the user registration POST request (e.g., router.post('/register', ...), likely in a file like server/routes/auth.ts or server/user-routes.ts).
Examine the validation schema or logic applied to the incoming request body for this route (e.g., within validate(...), Joi.object().keys(...), or direct manual checks).
Identify the root cause of the "Email, password, first name, and company name are required" error when all fields are present. This could be:
A mismatch between the incoming form field names (e.g., firstName) and what the server-side validation expects (e.g., first_name).
Incorrect parsing of the request body middleware.
A logical error within the validation rules themselves.
Proposed Solution:

Implement the necessary code changes to ensure the server-side validation correctly recognizes and processes all required sign-up fields (email, password, first name, company name) when they are properly provided in the request.
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have identified and implemented the fix, please provide a comprehensive diff preview that includes:

The exact file path of the modified file.
The approximate line numbers where the change occurred.
The current code block before your modification.
The modified code block after your change.
Success Criteria for My Approval:

The diff clearly shows the specific line(s) or block(s) that were changed.
The change directly addresses the root cause of the incorrect "required fields missing" error.
The new validation logic will correctly allow a user to sign up when all necessary fields are provided.
No unrelated code lines are affected.
The proposed solution aligns with the overall code style and best practices of the project.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. Please proceed with the investigation and proposed fix.
