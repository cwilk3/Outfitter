Thank you for the truly phenomenal work in fixing the severe code corruption! This is a game-changer and explains so much.

Now, let's address the new runtime error: experienceLocations?.map is not a function. This means experienceLocations is not an array (or is null/undefined) when .map() is called on it.

Your primary task is to investigate the experienceLocations?.map is not a function error in client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx and implement a fix to ensure experienceLocations is an array when .map() is called.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

File: client/src/pages/Experiences.tsx
Locate the Error: Find the exact line number where experienceLocations?.map is being called.
Trace experienceLocations Source:
How is experienceLocations being declared or initialized?
What is its expected type?
Where does its data come from (e.g., useState, useQuery, prop)?
Add Diagnostic Logging (Temporary): Add console.log statements just before the .map() call:
Log experienceLocations's value.
Log typeof experienceLocations.
Log Array.isArray(experienceLocations).
Proposed Code Changes:

You will need to propose the exact diff after your investigation. The fix will involve ensuring experienceLocations is initialized as an empty array or ensuring its data source consistently provides an array.

Output Required for My Review:
Based on your investigation, please provide:

The exact line number of the error.
The exact code block where experienceLocations?.map is being called.
Details about experienceLocations's source and initial value.
A proposed diff preview of the code changes to fix the error, including temporary diagnostic logs.
The full browser console output after attempting to reproduce the error (after implementing the diagnostic logs).
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation and proposed fix phase):

The root cause of experienceLocations?.map is not a function is clearly identified.
The proposed diff correctly modifies the logic to ensure experienceLocations is an array.
Diagnostic logging is included to verify the fix's behavior.
No other unrelated functional code is affected.
This fix is crucial for getting the Experiences.tsx page to render correctly. I await your detailed report.
