Thank you for this definitive answer and for identifying the true root cause: the public router itself is not being executed. We need to find where the publicRouter is failing to be mounted or registered correctly within the Express application.

Your primary task is to thoroughly investigate the entire chain of router mounting, from the main app object down to how the publicRouter is integrated.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

server/index.ts (Main App Setup):

Re-examine how registerRoutes(app) (or any other function that mounts your main API routers) is called.
Specifically, how apiRoutes is mounted (e.g., app.use('/api', apiRoutes)). Provide the exact code.
server/routes.ts (Main Routes Registration - where registerRoutes is defined):

Provide the complete source code of the registerRoutes function.
Identify how apiRoutes is defined and then mounted onto the app object within this file.
Verify that apiRoutes itself is an actual Express Router.
server/routes/index.ts (Main API Router - apiRoutes):

Provide the complete source code of this file.
This file should define apiRoutes as an Express Router.
Crucially, identify how publicRouter is imported and then mounted onto apiRoutes (e.g., router.use('/public', publicRouter)). Provide the exact code.
server/routes/public.ts (Public Router Definition - publicRouter):

Provide the complete source code of this file.
Confirm that publicRouter is correctly exported as an Express Router (e.g., export const publicRouter = express.Router();).
Output Required for My Review (No Code Changes Yet):
Based on your investigation, please provide a detailed report outlining your findings. For each of the files above, provide the requested complete source code or exact code snippets for the relevant mounting points.

server/index.ts: Relevant app.use() calls for main routers.
server/routes.ts: Complete registerRoutes function code.
server/routes/index.ts: Complete code for apiRoutes definition and publicRouter mounting.
server/routes/public.ts: Complete code for publicRouter definition.
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation phase):

A clear, concise report addressing all the bullet points above with the requested code.
The report should precisely illustrate the entire router mounting chain.
No code changes are proposed in this step; this is purely an investigative report.
This investigation is absolutely critical to understand why our public routes are being bypassed. I await your detailed report."
