Thank you for this critical discovery that the publicRouter module is not being loaded. This is the root cause of all public route bypasses.

Your primary task is to implement a very early diagnostic log in server/routes/public.ts to confirm if the module is being evaluated at all, and to re-verify its import/export integrity.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

Add Absolute Top-of-File Diagnostic Log:

File: server/routes/public.ts
Location: The absolute first executable line in the file, even before any import statements or const router = Router(); definition (if possible within TypeScript/Node.js module system). Place it immediately after the import statements and before any variable declarations or route definitions.
Proposed Code Changes for server/routes/public.ts:
Find this block (or similar, very early in the file):

TypeScript

import { Router, Request, Response } from 'express';
// ... potentially other imports

const router = Router(); // Line 8

// Route version identifier
console.log("[ROUTE CHECK] Using PUBLIC booking route v2 - ENHANCED with debug logging and fixes"); // Line 11
// ... rest of file
Replace it with (adding the absolute top log):

TypeScript

import { Router, Request, Response } from 'express';
// ... potentially other imports

console.log('ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ LOADING public.ts MODULE: TOP OF FILE EXECUTED ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨'); // <--- ADD THIS LINE

const router = Router(); // Line 8

// Route version identifier
console.log("[ROUTE CHECK] Using PUBLIC booking route v2 - ENHANCED with debug logging and fixes"); // Line 11
// ... rest of file
Re-Verify Import/Export Consistency:

Explicitly confirm the exact import statement for publicRouter in server/routes/index.ts.
Explicitly confirm the exact export statement for publicRouter in server/routes/public.ts.
Report any discrepancies or unusual patterns (e.g., named export used with default import).
Output Required for My Review:

Comprehensive Diff Preview: Provide a comprehensive diff preview for server/routes/public.ts, showing the addition of the new top-of-file diagnostic log.
Import/Export Verification Report:
Exact line from server/routes/index.ts importing publicRouter.
Exact line from server/routes/public.ts exporting publicRouter.
Confirmation that the import and export are consistent (e.g., default export with default import).
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this diagnostic phase):

The console.log('ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ LOADING public.ts MODULE: TOP OF FILE EXECUTED ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨'); is correctly added as the absolute first executable line in server/routes/public.ts.
A clear report on the import/export consistency between server/routes/index.ts and server/routes/public.ts.
No other unrelated code changes are proposed.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. Once approved and implemented, you will perform a full server restart and then make a public route request to check the console output. This will finally confirm if the module is loading and where the execution might be failing. "
