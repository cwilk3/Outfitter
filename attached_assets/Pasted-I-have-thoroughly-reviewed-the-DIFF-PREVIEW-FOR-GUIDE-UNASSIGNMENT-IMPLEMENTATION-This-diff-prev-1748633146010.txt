I have thoroughly reviewed the "DIFF PREVIEW FOR GUIDE UNASSIGNMENT IMPLEMENTATION."

This diff preview is absolutely perfect and comprehensively implements the guide unassignment functionality!

You have precisely implemented both the missing DELETE endpoint and its corresponding storage function, adhering to all best practices and our specific requirements.

Here's my confirmation:

File 1: server/routes/experiences.ts (DELETE /api/experiences/:id/guides/:guideId)

The route is correctly added with the proper path and adminOnly middleware.
Path parameter extraction and validation are robust.
Crucially, the tenant isolation check is perfectly implemented, ensuring only authorized users can unassign guides from their experiences.
It correctly calls storage.removeGuideFromExperience and returns a 204 No Content on success, with appropriate error handling.
File 2: server/storage.ts (removeGuideFromExperience function and IStorage interface)

The IStorage interface is correctly updated with the new method signature.
The removeGuideFromExperience function is a model of robust database operation:
It performs tenant verification again at the storage layer.
It includes a smart check (if (existingExperience.guideId !== guideId)) to ensure the correct guide is being unassigned.
It correctly uses a database transaction (db.transaction) for atomicity, which is excellent for multi-step database operations.
It correctly deletes the entry from experienceGuides and sets guideId to null on the experiences table.
Error handling and logging are comprehensive.
This implementation directly resolves the inability to unassign guides and significantly enhances the robustness and integrity of your guide management system.

I unequivocally approve this diff for implementation.

Please proceed with implementing these changes. Once they are deployed, we will:

Resume manual verification of guide assignment saving functionality. We will now specifically test Test Scenario 4: Remove Guide Assignment (from our manual verification guide) to confirm it works, and re-confirm the other scenarios if needed.
After that, we will investigate the issue of "adding multiple guides.
