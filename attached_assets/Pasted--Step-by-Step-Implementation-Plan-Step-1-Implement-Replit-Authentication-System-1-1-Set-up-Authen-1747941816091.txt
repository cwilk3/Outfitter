ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Step 1: Implement Replit Authentication System
1.1 Set up Authentication Infrastructure
Add Replit Auth configuration to server/replitAuth.ts
Configure session management with database storage
Set up authentication middleware for protected routes
1.2 Create Authentication Routes
/api/login - redirects to Replit OAuth
/api/logout - handles logout flow
/api/auth/user - returns current authenticated user
/api/callback - handles OAuth callback
1.3 Update Frontend Authentication
Create useAuth hook for authentication state
Add login/logout buttons to navigation
Implement protected route components
Handle authentication redirects
Step 2: Create Multi-Tenant Architecture
2.1 Database Schema Updates
Add outfitterId field to core tables:
experiences table
bookings table
locations table
add_ons table
guides relationships
Create outfitters table with company info
Update all foreign key relationships
2.2 Data Isolation Implementation
Modify all storage methods to filter by outfitterId
Update API endpoints to automatically scope queries
Add middleware to inject outfitterId from authenticated user
Ensure no cross-outfitter data leakage
2.3 User-Outfitter Association
Update users table to link users to specific outfitters
Create user roles within outfitter context (admin, guide)
Implement outfitter onboarding flow for new users
Step 3: Update Storage Layer
3.1 Modify DatabaseStorage Class
Add outfitter-scoped methods for all CRUD operations
Update queries to include WHERE outfitterId = ? clauses
Ensure guide assignments respect outfitter boundaries
3.2 API Route Protection
Add authentication middleware to all protected routes
Inject outfitter context into request handlers
Validate user permissions for outfitter-specific actions
Step 4: Frontend Multi-Tenancy
4.1 User Context Management
Create outfitter context provider
Update all API calls to include outfitter scope
Handle outfitter switching (if users belong to multiple)
4.2 UI Updates
Add outfitter branding/customization capability
Show outfitter-specific data only
Create onboarding flow for new outfitters
ðŸ”‘ Critical Success Factors:
Zero Data Cross-Pollution: Each outfitter sees only their data
Secure Authentication: Real user accounts, not hardcoded IDs
Scalable Architecture: Easy to add new outfitters
Clean Migration: Existing data transitions smoothly
ðŸ“‹ Key Questions Before Implementation:
Should we create a "super admin" role that can see all outfitters?
Do users belong to one outfitter or potentially multiple?
Should we implement outfitter subdomain routing (e.g., acmeoutfitters.yourapp.com)?
This approach ensures your platform can securely handle multiple outfitters with complete data isolation from day one.
