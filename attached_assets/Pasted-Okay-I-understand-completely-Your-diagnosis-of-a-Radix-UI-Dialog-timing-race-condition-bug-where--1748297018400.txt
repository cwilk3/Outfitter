Okay, I understand completely. Your diagnosis of a Radix UI Dialog timing/race condition bug, where `pointer-events: none;` gets stuck on the `<body>` due to rapid dialog state transitions, is the definitive root cause.

We need to introduce a small delay between closing the booking dialog and opening the confirmation dialog to allow for proper `<body>` style cleanup.

Please modify the file `client/src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx`.

Locate the `onSubmit` function (around line 250-280 in your current code, where `setBookingConfirmation`, `setBookingDialogOpen`, and `setConfirmationDialogOpen` are called).

**Change the state updates for the dialogs to include a `setTimeout` for the confirmation dialog:**

**Find this block (or similar):**
```typescript
    // Inside onSubmit, after apiRequest returns successfully
    setBookingConfirmation(response);
    setBookingDialogOpen(false);
    setConfirmationDialogOpen(true); // This line
    console.log('DEBUG: onSubmit - State updated for confirmation dialog.');
Replace it with:

TypeScript

    // Inside onSubmit, after apiRequest returns successfully
    setBookingConfirmation(response);
    setBookingDialogOpen(false);
    // Introduce a small delay before opening the confirmation dialog
    // This allows the booking dialog's cleanup (removing pointer-events: none) to complete
    setTimeout(() => {
      setConfirmationDialogOpen(true);
      console.log('DEBUG: onSubmit - Confirmation dialog state set after delay.'); // NEW DEBUG LOG
    }, 50); // 50ms delay is usually sufficient
    console.log('DEBUG: onSubmit - State updated for confirmation dialog (delay initiated).'); // Modified Log
Please provide a comprehensive diff preview of this change. I will review it carefully before you approve.

Success Criteria for my approval:

A setTimeout is introduced for setConfirmationDialogOpen(true).
The delay is set to 50 milliseconds.
The console.log statements are updated as shown.
No other code lines are affected.
I will not approve the change until these criteria are met.

After approval and implementation, you will need to:

Restart your frontend application.
Go through the public booking flow and click "Complete Booking" to test if the button is now responsive and the confirmation dialog appears correctly.
