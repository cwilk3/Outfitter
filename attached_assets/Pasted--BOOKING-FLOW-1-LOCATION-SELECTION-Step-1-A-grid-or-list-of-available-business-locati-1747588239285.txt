## ✅ BOOKING FLOW

### 1️⃣ LOCATION SELECTION (Step 1)
- A grid or list of available business locations (e.g., Kansas Fields, Oklahoma Lodge, Texas Ranch).
- Each location card should:
  - Display the name, city/state
  - Optional: Small photo or icon
- Once a location is selected, transition to the next step.

### 2️⃣ DATE SELECTION + EXPERIENCE DETAILS (Step 2)
When the user reaches this step, **display a full experience overview**, populated directly from the experience object created in the dashboard.

- Base Price per hunter (e.g., $250 / hunter)
- Rich description text
- Photo carousel or featured media

#### 👥 Hunter Count Selector:
- Inline control for selecting number of hunters (e.g., dropdown or stepper)
- Price should update dynamically (e.g., 2 hunters × $250 = $500)
