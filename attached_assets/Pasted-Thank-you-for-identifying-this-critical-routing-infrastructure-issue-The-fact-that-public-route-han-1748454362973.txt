Thank you for identifying this critical routing infrastructure issue. The fact that public route handlers are being bypassed entirely is a severe problem that needs immediate attention.

Your primary task is to thoroughly investigate the main application routing setup to identify what is intercepting or masking GET /api/public/:outfitterId/* requests, preventing them from reaching the handlers in server/routes/public.ts.

Specific Focus Areas for Investigation:

Main Server Entry Point (e.g., server/index.ts or app.ts):

Provide the complete source code of this file, paying close attention to the order of app.use(), app.get(), app.post(), and any other route or middleware mounting calls.
Look for any wildcard routes (app.get('/*', app.use('/'), app.use('*')), static file serving middleware (express.static), or proxy configurations that might be defined before your specific modular API routes.
Public Router Mounting:

Confirm how the router from server/routes/public.ts is imported and mounted into the main application. For example, is it app.use('/api', publicRouter) or app.use('/api/public', publicRouter)?
Verify the order of this mounting relative to other routes or catch-all middleware.
Middleware Order:

Examine the order of all app.use() calls. A general rule is that more specific routes/middleware should come before more general/catch-all ones.
Development Server (e.g., Vite/Webpack) Proxies:

If applicable, investigate any proxy configurations in your development server that might be handling /api/public/ requests differently than expected.
Output Required for My Review (No Code Changes Yet):
Based on your investigation, please provide a detailed report outlining your findings. Answer the following questions:

Complete Source Code of Main Server Entry Point: Provide the full content of server/index.ts (or equivalent file).
Identified Interceptor: What specific line(s) or block(s) of code do you suspect are intercepting the requests for /api/public/invalid/locations? Provide the relevant code snippet.
Proposed Root Cause: Based on your findings, what is your most likely conclusion about why the public route handlers are being bypassed?
Success Criteria for My Approval (for this investigation phase):

A clear, concise report addressing all the bullet points above.
The report identifies the specific file(s) and code sections relevant to the routing issue.
No code changes are proposed in this step; this is purely an investigative report.
This investigation is paramount to restoring the correct request flow and ensuring the multi-tenant security for public routes. I await your detailed report."
