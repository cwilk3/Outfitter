Thank you for this detailed analysis. The problem is clear: the role parameter is not being processed correctly by the backend's /api/users endpoint, despite the frontend sending it.

Your primary task is to add highly targeted diagnostic logging within the GET /api/users route handler in server/routes.ts to trace the role parameter's extraction and processing.

Specific Focus Areas for Modification:

File: server/routes.ts
Location: Within the router.get('/api/users', ...) handler, specifically where req.query.role is extracted and the roles array is constructed.
Proposed Code Changes:

Find this block (within the GET /api/users handler, after outfitterId extraction):

TypeScript

// Inside the router.get('/api/users', ...) handler:
// ...
// Extract role(s) flexibly: allow 'role=guide' or 'role=admin,guide'
let roles: string[] | undefined;
if (typeof req.query.role === 'string' && req.query.role) {
    roles = req.query.role.split(',').map(r => r.trim());
} else if (Array.isArray(req.query.role)) {
    roles = req.query.role.map(r => r.toString());
}

// Get users for this outfitter, filtered by role(s)
const users = await storage.getUsersByOutfitterId(outfitterId, roles);

// ... rest of handler
Replace it with (adding diagnostic logs):

TypeScript

// Inside the router.get('/api/users', ...) handler:
// ...
console.log('--- DIAGNOSTIC: GET /api/users Role Filtering ---'); // <--- ADD THIS LINE
console.log('üîç [API_USERS_DEBUG] req.query:', JSON.stringify(req.query, null, 2)); // <--- ADD THIS LINE
console.log('üîç [API_USERS_DEBUG] req.query.role RAW:', req.query.role); // <--- ADD THIS LINE
console.log('üîç [API_USERS_DEBUG] typeof req.query.role:', typeof req.query.role); // <--- ADD THIS LINE

// Extract role(s) flexibly: allow 'role=guide' or 'role=admin,guide'
let roles: string[] | undefined;
if (typeof req.query.role === 'string' && req.query.role) {
    roles = req.query.role.split(',').map(r => r.trim());
} else if (Array.isArray(req.query.role)) {
    roles = req.query.role.map(r => r.toString());
}
console.log('üîç [API_USERS_DEBUG] Processed roles array:', roles); // <--- ADD THIS LINE

// Get users for this outfitter, filtered by role(s)
const users = await storage.getUsersByOutfitterId(outfitterId, roles);

// ... rest of handler
Output Required for My Review:
Once you have implemented this modification, please provide a comprehensive diff preview for server/routes.ts. After approval, you will perform a new test request from the frontend (to fetch guides for an experience) and provide the complete console output from these new logs.

Success Criteria for My Approval (for this diagnostic phase):

The console.log statements with üîç [API_USERS_DEBUG] prefix are correctly added within the GET /api/users route handler in server/routes.ts.
The logs correctly capture req.query, req.query.role (raw), its typeof, and the final roles array.
No other unrelated functional code lines are affected.
The purpose is solely diagnostic; no functional fix is expected from this specific diff.
I will not approve this step until these criteria are met. This logging is crucial to understand why the role parameter is not being processed.
